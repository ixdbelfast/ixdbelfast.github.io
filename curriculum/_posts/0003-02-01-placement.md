## Rationale

This optional module provides an opportunity for students to gain first hand practical experience within a professional environment prior to their final year of study. This module integrates education with the creative industries. It provides students with a range of experiences and skills relative to their practice, future career and professional development. 

The module is designed to facilitate opportunities for students to interpret and practice their academic knowledge, develop personal, transferrable, professional and entrepreneurial skills and develop a knowledge and understanding of the role of the practitioner within the creative industries. 


## Aims

The essential aims of this module are:

+ Enhance a student’s awareness in a professional and social context of the workplace 
+ Consolidate, complement and extend a student’s academic programme of study
+ Develop personal and professional skills that will contribute towards a student’s employability



## Content 

The student will gain professional experience in a creative environment as part of a team in an industrial or commercial context, or workshop/studio/community or curatorial context. There will be clear direction given by the Placement Tutor and Placement Partner to allow the student to fulfill a self directed programme of work, which will be continually monitored by the Industrial Supervisor and periodically by the Visiting Academic Tutor.  

Preparation for placement is delivered during Level 5 in order to develop reflective learning skills to enhance the quality of learning from work experience.
