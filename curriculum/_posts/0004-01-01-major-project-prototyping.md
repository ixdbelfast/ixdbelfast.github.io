## Rationale

This module focuses on equipping students with the idea generation and prototyping skills required to produce a substantial and challenging body of work for the Major Project module in the following semester. It is intended to form a springboard for the students’ final outcome and is very closely linked to the deliverables of that module.

The module aims to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of the various aspects of idea generation, project preparation, management and delivery, required to undertake a substantial piece of project work. The module is designed to help students develop their individual design skills, identities and direction, enabling them to develop a realistic and meaningful piece of work during their final year.

Through an emphasis on developing iterative prototypes at a range of fidelities – including sketches, paper prototypes, wireframes and functional prototypes – and testing these extensively, students are equipped with the building blocks required to bring ideas into form and embark on their Major Project successfully. 

A structured lecture programme, coupled with a series of idea generation workshops, paper-prototyping workshops and applied lab sessions, equips students with the skills required to prototype their ideas and test their validity before embarking on the Major Project.


## Aims

The essential aims of this module are:

+ To introduce students to a range of design research approaches.
+ To add to the students’ idea generation repertoire.
+ To further develop students’ paper-prototyping skills, ensuring they complete the programme with a clear understanding of the importance of thinking through paper.
+ To equip students with the skills required to convincingly pitch their ideas in a confident and reasoned manner.
+ To develop students individual design skills and identities, informing their Major Project module in the final semester.
+ To build a series of prototypes that will inform and guide the construction of their Major Project.


## Content

Students are supported through a weekly lecture programme that is designed to broaden their knowledge and understanding. Lecture and seminar content are centred on developing students’ understanding of the idea generation process, with a focus on learning from international models of excellence.

Models developed in both industry (IDEO, Frog Design) and academia (d.school, Hyperisland) are introduced and explored, forming a basis for evolving a solid idea generation process and methodology.

Indicative lecture content includes:

+ The Myths of Innovation
+ Idea Generation
+ Brainstorming
+ Six Thinking Hats
+ Radiant Thinking and Widening the Frame of Reference
+ Randomness
+ Collaborative Approaches and Hot Teams
+ Space as Creative Facilitator
+ Paper- and Digital-Prototyping
