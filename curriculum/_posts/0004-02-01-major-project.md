## Rationale

This module focuses on equipping students with a combination of skills, centred on the design and build of a sustained piece of coursework, which enables them to showcase what they have learned throughout the entirety of the course. The aim of the module is to highlight the depth and breadth of knowledge students have acquired whilst on the course.

The module offers students support and feedback towards the development of a sustained body of work, which comes together in the form of a Major Project, designed to showcase the student’s abilities.

The module allows students to identify and focus on a topic that interests them, enabling them to demonstrate what they have learned throughout the course. Within the project the student is expected to integrate and apply their learning from other modules on the course through the completion of a high level piece of work.

Through the creation of a substantial piece of work students demonstrate an understanding of both the project management and quality assurance skills needed to work within industry, assisting them in the process of securing employment.
