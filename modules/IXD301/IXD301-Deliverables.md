IXD301 Deliverables
========================

This page is designed to give you a clear breakdown of the deliverables expected for the module. There are two deliverables:

## + Deliverable 1 - Module Deliverables (60%)
## + Deliverable 2 – Research, Discovery and Supporting Material (40%)

This module will focus on content in all its forms and will give students a thorough understanding of how to structure and manage content in both a theoretical and practical sense.

## Deliverable Breakdown

Deliverable 1 (60%)
--------------------------------------------

### Portfolio Website

In order to be fully prepared for placement opportunities you need to have a strong online portfolio. This should give prospective employers a sense of who you are, your interests, capabilities and aspirations.

### Elements Website

Design and create a website to explain elements from the periodic table.
The Periodic Table as we know, is a table of the chemical elements arranged in order of atomic number, so that elements with similar atomic structure appear in vertical columns.  

The content is scientific to be used by those in the science profession.  Nevertheless what about young people or undergraduate students. Is the content aiding or confusing their understanding of the periodic table elements? Using IxD is it possible to enhance learning through a better thoughtful design by considering the content, micro/macro level interaction or even gamification. 

This project will ask you to look at the content of the periodic table from the micro packets of information in each cell on the periodic table to the wider range of content when looking at the details of each element.  

Project Requirements 

+ A branded homepage containing your version of the periodic table
+ At least five additional element pages aimed at the 12–14 year old audience OR
+ At least five element page aimed at undergraduate chemistry student.
+ A style guide to accompany design
+ The delivery platform for this project is Jekyll
 
In addition to your work you are required to have a full sketch book/ loose pages of drawings, ideas, concepts, thoughts, inspiration, context, designs.  Digital prototypes can also be displayed on your Tumblr.

### Micropublication Masterclass
--------------------------------------------
A Micropublication Masterclass will make up Week 01. We’ll be developing concepts for ‘micro-publications’ – short, easy to consume content frgaments – and exploring how these might be packaged, delivered and consumed. Our goal is to create a portfolio piece that might (but needn’t be) developed further.

Deliverable 2 (40%)
-------------------

###Research, Discovery and Supporting Sketches
Throughout the module you will be required to maintain a journal, using Tumblr, (or for IMD your workspace) which maps your research, idea development, sketches, prototypes, etc, for Deliverable 1.

**All deliverables are due in Week 13**
