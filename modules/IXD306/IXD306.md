>“On average students completing a placement year achieve a higher degree classification compared with those who don’t take placement  eg  2:1 compared  to 2:2.”
<cite>—High Fliers Research Limited 2016</cite>

>“In terms of advice I’d say try to get out and network as much as possible - there’s plenty of events in Belfast. I’d also say side projects, freelance work which you’ve shared online via dribbble or twitter - gets your name out there & helps you increase your skills.”
<cite>—Mark Kelso, Glaze</cite>

- Who inspires you?
- What drives you to succeed?
- What is your biggest achievement?
- Have you heard of SCSS? What do you think of it?

#### How do I develop my ‘employability skills’?
There are many ways in which you can make yourself more employable:
+ **Work Experience:** Part-time job, Placement, Voluntary Work, Entrepreneurship
+ **Academia:** Subject Specific Modules, Career Management Modules, Study Abroad 
+ **Leisure / Hobbies:** Sport, DIY, Language Course, 

#### How do I write a good application?
The key to a good application is making sure your Skills, Abilities, Knowledge & Experience (SAKE) fit the job and/or person specification.

In these highly competitive times, you’re unlikely to get far if you can’t align your SAKE to all or most of the essential requirements.

#### Preparation is key
Research the company — 
Its Development, Expansion,  Markets,  Products, Mission Statement,  Its Values,  Its Ethos /Culture.

Often the application form will test your knowledge of contemporary issues which face a particular organisation.  This is to check that you have done your prep work.

#### Application form checklist
- **Follow instructions**, for example about the use of block capitals, black ink, your own handwriting and word limits 
- **Complete every section or insert NA** (not applicable) if it doesn’t apply to you
Pay attention to your writing style. Use action verbs such as ‘organised’, ‘responsible’, ‘managed’, ‘lead’, ‘planned’ to create a dynamic, competent image
- **Check for mistakes** in grammar, spelling and punctuation
- **Compare what you have written with the job description** - is it concise, clearly illustrating why you are right for the job? 
- **Re-read** your draft answers to the questions while imagining you’re the employer. Do they impress you? Would you want to interview this applicant?
- **Keep a copy** of the form so that you can read it before the interview
