## Deliverable Breakdown

Deliverable 1 (60%)
-------------------

### Digital Product
The design and creation of your icon set is the first of two deliverables for this module. The icon set should be vector based (i.e. created in Adobe Illustrator, Sketch or any other vector-based programme). Final output should be appropriate to the approach you have taken â€“ SVGs, JPGs, PNGs, GIFs, a combination of these, or all four.

### Promotional Website
With your digital product (icons) in place, you need to design and build a website to show them off to the best of their ability. The website design should be appropriate to the visual approach taken for your icon set.

Deliverable 2 (40%)

###Research, Discovery and Supporting Sketches
Throughout the module you will be required to maintain a journal, using Tumblr, (or for IMD your workspace) which maps your research, idea development, sketches, prototypes, etc, for Deliverable 1.

**All deliverables are due in Week 13**
