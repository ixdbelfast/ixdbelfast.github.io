IXD302 | DES311 Creative Entrepreneurship
================================

This module introduces students to the ideas and principles, which underpin creative entrepreneurship, placing a heavy focus on the emerging and rapidly growing field of digital product design.

Through a focus on companies and individuals that have built digital products – from the very large (for example, global tools like Facebook and Twitter) to the very small (for example, sole designers developing products like icons and typefaces) – students are encouraged to develop an entrepreneurial mindset.

## Detailed View

### Week 01 – What is Creative Entrepreneurship?
__29 September, 2017__

So, what makes an entrepreneur?

>"The critical ingredient is getting off your butt and doing something. It’s as simple as that. A lot of people have ideas, but there are few who decide to do something about them now. Not tomorrow. Not next week. But today. The true entrepreneur is a doer, not a dreamer.”
<cite>Nolan Bushnell, Entrepreneur</cite>

The term entrepreneur, in part has come to mean *someone who has his or her own startup or business*. The difference between an entrepreneur and a small business lies in the income generated. Where a small business may generate an income that may replace traditional employment an entrepreneur will generate substantial wealth. This wealth is often created much quicker than traditional business methods, a five year span isn’t unusual.

### Week 02 – The Creative Process
__06 October, 2017__

>“Spend time falling in love with things that aren’t design, and let those things influence your work. Inspiration comes from everywhere and all good designers talk about how much they’re inspired by architecture, fine art, books, nature, etc.”
<cite>–Jessica Hische</cite>

The creative process is unique for everyone, there is no single formula for getting ‘into the zone’ and starting those creative juices flowing.

There are however, a few things we can do to help. James Webb Young’s excellent little book, [‘A Technique for Producing Ideas’](http://amzn.to/2lSYV0k) sets out a process that can help us a develop our ideas.

He suggests:

1. **Gather raw material** – Not just for the project in hand but gather material for everything that interests you. As Hische says in the quote above, ‘inspiration comes from everywhere’, so start gathering.

2. **Digest what you have gathered** – Once you have exhausted your research, allow time for the material to assimilate.

3. **Unconscious processing** – Sleep on it and allow your subconscious do the hard work for you.

4. **Everything clicks into place** – As Young calls it “a-ha! moment” when your idea seemingly comes out of thin air.

5. **Idea meets reality** – As Young puts it your idea meets “the cold, grey dawn of the morning after,” and has to face reality. This is when you can seek feedback from your peers to check how robust your idea is. 

Of course, on occasions it isn’t as straightworward as this, but over time, and with experience, things will start to click into place.

Developing habits prior to starting work helps get the mind ready, it tells the brain, ‘now is the time for creativity, so let’s get on with it!’

### Week 04 – Stand Out From The Crowd
__20 October, 2017__

>“You can be stronger when you are not wanting it, if you just do it out of love and trust, then that is when you find what you are looking for.”
<cite>–Samuel T Herring.</cite>

There are literally hundreds, globally, thousands, of young and up-and-coming designers and developers emerging onto the jobs market every year. In today’s session we asked. **What can you do to stand out from the crowd?**

The common traits you’ll find in everyone who’s successful, is that have a story, they’re creating interesting work and they’re building relationships. Attending events, being active on the web, Twitter, Dribbble, Linkedin, etc, counts. When someone you respect does something great, take a few moments to let them know what you think, it’s a big part of being a good human. And there can never be enough of them.

### Week 07 – Minimum Viable Product
__10 November, 2017__

>“The minimum viable product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.”
<cite>—Eric Ries</cite>

A plain doughnut, like our minimum viable product offers a small, entry level product to test the market upon which we can scale based on interest. If the market likes it we can add a variety of toppings and flavours to expand our product and reach a wider audience. 

We need to get the core serving of our product right first before we can add more features.

Through the eyes of one of the founders [Joe Gebbia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKxNhkzfTWg), we took a look at how Airbnb grew from a blowup mattress and breakfast in the front room of his shared apartment to the world-wide phenomenon it is today.

### Week 09 – Digital Pricing Models
__24 November, 2017__

>“As with all matters of pricing, there’s no “one true way”, but there are lots of wrong turns and dead ends. Avoid those and you’re in good shape.”
<cite>– Des Traynor, Intercom</cite>

Pricing your product appropriately ensures that you can reach as wide an audience as possible. Do it right and your product, provided it’s something people want, will be a success. Get it wrong and you are likely to under, or over price yourself out of the market.

#### Quality, Price and Demand

It all comes down to the quality of your product and the demand. Apple currently have it right. Their computers may be a lot more expensive than many similar PCs, but people are more than willing to pay more for that perceived quality. That will only last as long as Apple are able to meet consumer demands for a high quality, innovative, reliable product.

Pricing your product all depends on what’s on offer. MailChimp offers volume sales with a tiered pricing structure. Their success depends on companies sending out tens or hundreds of thousands or even millions of emails per month and paying for that service. As the volume increases then so does the monthly cost.

Offering a tiered pricing structure provides people with the option to start low and build up from there. [TinyBooks Pricing Plan](http://tinybooks.org/books/start/) offers the user a range purchasing option. 

With three pricing options £72, £18 and £9, Tinybooks have given themselves a 80/20 chance that people will take up one of the options. With only one option the user is left with a buy or don’t buy option, cutting down that chance of a purchase to 50/50.

#### How much should we charge?

Most businesses are eventually faced with the key question: How much should we charge? There is no one true answer.

- Believing everyone should be happy to pay for your product.

- Believing there is some mythical “perfect” price which extracts maximum revenue from every single customer.

- Believing product pricing can never be changed once chosen. 

- Delaying charging indefinitely as a result of 1, 2 and 3.

Other options can include leaving the decision of what to pay up to the customer. [Lost Type](http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=escafina) leave it up to the buyer to pay what they feel the fonts are worth. With a minimum price per font, they are guaranteed enough to cover their own costs.

If you are offering your product for free, rather than simply giving is away, adding a [Pay with a Tweet](https://www.paywithatweet.com/?locale=en) option can reward your hard work with a little more publicity and a wider audience.
