Responsive Storytelling
=======================


Masterclass Overview
--------------------

The lessons in this masterclass are drawn from the tried and tested teaching on the BDes (Hons) Interaction Design programme at the Belfast School of Art.

This content has been developed by Chris Murphy and I have added a sprinkling here and there.

We use an approach called 'Master-Apprentice' that encourages learning through focused copying. The idea (it's an age one) is that the apprentice learns by re-making the works of the master, in so doing developing the skills needed to succeed.

You will complete one lesson every two weeks.

This series of lessons follows a similar model, with everything you need to learn broken down into a series of discrete elements.*

\* Everything covered here is designed to map onto your Bird Project deliverable.  In other words do it once, apply twice.

Heroes and Villains
-------------------

In the spirit of academia – 'standing on the shoulders of giants' and building on the work of those before – the masterclass's project content is inspired by Ethan Marcotte's ['The Baker Street Inquirer'](http://alistapart.com/d/responsive-web-design/ex/ex-site-flexible.html). (In the interests of full disclosure, Ethan is a friend.)

Originally developed in 2010 for A List Apart, to accompany Ethan's article [Responsive Web Design](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design), 'The Baker Street Inquirer' (and, of course, Ethan's article) woke the web towards the possibilities that responsive web design (RWD) offered.

As a practising designer – who wears both industry and academic hats – I wanted to offer a small hat tip to Ethan, a good friend, and 'Heroes and Villains' seemed like a lovely way to do that.


Lesson 1: HTML and Semantics
----------------------------

Before we do anything we look for meaning. HTML is a design element. Let's not forget that. In the first lesson we look for meaning by reading and understanding the content supplied. Etc.


###Exercise 1A

/* The first exercise is a worksheet that is supplied. It's A4 and it's downloadable and printable. The idea is the students look at the markup below and identify the elements on the worksheet. */

[Download Worksheet Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/d8rfu1i7oshb6ej/HTML%20and%20Semantic%20Handout.pdf?dl=0)

Download the worksheet and identify the following elements. Note: Markup is a tricky beast and there are many ways of marking up content. Your version may be different to ours, that's OK, as long as you've thought through the decisions you're making.

`h1`, `h2`, `p`, `header`, `article`, `section`, `blockquote`, `cite`, `aside`, `footer`, `strong`, `em`, `b`, `i`, `small`

Bonus: It's debatable whether this page contains an `article` element. We don't see the page as an article, per se. Your opinions may vary (and that's OK).


###Exercise 1B

Using what you learned from the first exercise, mark up the Baker Street copy supplied, focusing on amplifying semantics and meaning:

+ [Heroes and Villains Copy](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z2eor5ywz09y74e/Heroes%20and%20Villans.zip?dl=0)

Lesson 2: Art Direction and Element Collages
--------------------------------------------

When trying to convey a design idea, moods, feelings and fluffy stuff like that are hard to communicate. So as designers we often use mood boards: it can be a collection of images and text  from magazines, books, photos you have taken but which are related to a design theme as a reference point.  The first excercise is to create a moodboard for Heroes and Villains the second is an element collage.

###Exercise 2A

The first exercise is a moodboard for 'Heroes and Villans'. We need to show them one we've made earlier. Remember: Master-Apprentice.

[Heres one we made earlier](https://emilydavies95.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/img_0415.jpg)

Moodboards can be created with paper (my preference) you can look through items other than whats on screen such as magazines, posters, advertisements. Exolore, imagery, color, typography, layout etc. Cut these out and place them on a A3 sheet and group them together.  Paper moodboards are a great way of gathering inspiration beyond the screen.

It could be a digital moodboard - using a tool like Niice. For this excercise I would like to see at least one paper moodboard.


###Exercise 2B

The second exercise is an Style Tile.

Your goal is to create an Style Tile – appropriate to the 'Heroes and Villains' content – that draws on your moodboard to refine a look and feel. 

For guidance you might look at Samantha Warrens article on style tiles.

[A Style Tile could look like this](https://horseradish.s3.amazonaws.com/CACHE/images/photos/1c/ee/cc0ec44b4ea5/opencongress-element-collage-800.png)

Consider:

+ Colour Palette
+ Typographic Choices
  + Headlines
  + Body Copy
  + Blockquotes
+ Images
+ Button Styles
+ Etc..

Lesson 3: Typography
--------------------

As Information Architects' Oliver Riechenstein puts it:

> Web Design is 95% Typography

As such it's important to consider the typography for your 'Heroes and Villains' site. As with the previous lessons we've broken this down into a couple of exercises.

The first encourages you to explore web typography, including: Typekit and Google Fonts. The second takes the knowledge you learned in Exercise 3A and applies it to 'Heroes and Villans'.


###Exercise 3A

In order to explore how web typrography works I would like you to to find a piece of typography.  Ths could be from a magazine or a famous quote. Using Google Fonts or Typekit recreate it aka Master-Apprentice from HTML and CSS. We have included some examples:

+ [Typographic Details *Hat Tip Chris Murphy*](http://dev.monographic.org/typographicdetails/)
+ [Thunderbird](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5q1xjveob7ojdph/thunderbird.JPG?dl=0)
+ [Apple](https://www.dropbox.com/s/whvxda55a4py4v8/apple.JPG?dl=0)
+ [XXXX](#)

###Exercise 3B

Now that you have explored web typography we wish to apply this to your 'Heroes and Villans' project.  Remember to consider the typography for Headings, Blockquotes  and take inspiration from your moodboards and style tiles in Excercise 2.

Lesson 4: Responsive Web Design (RWD)
-------------------------------------

###Exercise 4A

Add CSS to your 'Heroes and Villans' site to enhance and amplify the content. This is a first pass and should focus on layout, color and images etc.


###Exercise 4B

By now you should have marked up your baker street copy in semantic HTML and CSS.  The task is now to make it responsive.

Create a layout for mobile, iphone, and ipad viewports using % for structural styling and ems for styling font-size.

CSS Media Queries are a feature in CSS3 which allows you to specify when certain CSS rules should be applied.  is allows you to apply a special CSS for mobile, or adjust a layout for print. A media query contains one or more expressions, expressed as media features, which resolve to either true or false. When result of the query is true the browser renders the css styles included that media query.

Lesson 5: Macro- and Micro-Interactions
---------------------------------------

The web is not a staic place.  It is full of interactions which provide stimulis, satisfaction and feedback.  All which make great user experiences.  

Microinteractions are contained product moments that do one small task.  They are so small, you don’t think about them. When you mute your phone, rate a product, or play music, you are engaging with a microinteraction. 

Dan Saffer notes that they:

+ Accomplish an individual task.
+ Communicate status and provide feedback on user actions.
+ Prevent human error.
+ Enhance the sense of direct manipulation.
+ Help users visualize the results of their actions.

The ’like’ button on social networks which highlights changes by using interactive animations. Such feedback informs users that they are in the list of those who liked the post. [Like here](https://dribbble.com/shots/1456699-Liking-Interaction-GIF)


###Exercise 5A

The first exercise is chunking content.  Chunking is critical for presenting content that users can comprehend and remember easily. Use chunking for text and multimedia content alike to help users understand underlying relationships and information hierarchy.


We'll use the following as a reference:

+ [Chunking Content](http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#firstPage)


###Exercise 5B

The second exercise is focused at a slightly more micro level. We're looking at :hover effects and creating prototypes that can then be rolled into the final page.

Design :hover buttons in Illustrator and provide a PDF for the students with off and on states. Get them to build them. I COULD PROVIDE THE .AI FILES AS A BONUS, ADDED VALUE.

Bonus Lesson: The Wonderful World of Maps
-------------------------------------


What is a map? Until the 1980s, maps were painstaking documents created by hand. These days maps are almost always made with the help of a computer. Maps today are commonplace, interspersed in driving directions, visualizations, and political boundary disputes. 

Computer maps are fundamentally composed of data. Data is in the abstract, composed of billions of points or just a few polygons, or a photo-like recording of colors and temperature. It is important that data is not specific to a certain usage.

###Bonus Exercise

Using one of the following create one map of the location of Sherlock Holmes Baker Street Home 221 Baker Street London.  This can be inluded for example on the bottom of your page.

+ [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/)
+ [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/index.html)
+ [Stamen](http://maps.stamen.com/#watercolor/12/54.6369/-6.0457)
