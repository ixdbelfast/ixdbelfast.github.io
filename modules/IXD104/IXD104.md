IXD104/DES107: Imaging and Data Visualisation
=============================================

We’ve been led to believe that a picture is worth a thousand words. This module puts that truism to the test. Exploring non-verbal communication, we introduce students to illustrative and diagrammatic approaches to communication. Showcasing the power of the image in communication the module equips students with the ability to not only create images, but also brief others’ on how to create images, and communicate data through image.

The module explores both paper- and screen-based approaches to image creation and introduces students to the differences between vector and raster images, in addition to various file formats and their appropriate uses.

By asking students to deliver their coursework using digital channels, for example tumblr blogs, students are also introduced to digital distribution methods and exposed to the various channels they might consider to develop and build their web-based profiles.

### Week 01: Introduction; Brief; Master Apprentice…  

__02 February, 2018__

This week we introduced the module, outlining the journey we'll be taking over the course of the semester. We'll be exploring the use of the imagery in design, focusing on the following: illustration and data visualisation.

We also introduced the idea of a Master-Apprentice model of learning, learning by copying the work of others.

### Project 01
Your first project is to create a travel app using illustration. It must have three screens - Home, Pick a City and a detail of the city.  You will complete this by doing a series of Master-Apprentice Excercises. The first one is below.

### Master Apprentice 01
Remake five of these icons - using sketch or illustrator.  You can make these [icons](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x6gkh3ot1ret0if/travel-icons_1x.png?dl=0) and these [icons](https://www.dropbox.com/s/eq58fehf99wxk0q/shot_1-19.jpg?dl=0).

Extra credit for doing all the icons!

### Week 02: Getting Iconic

__09 February, 2018__

This week we explored icon design considering the need to create icon sets as a part of the design process.

We looked at the history of icon design, from early history to more recent examples, including Otl Aicher's icons for the 1972 Munich Olympics and Susan Kare's icons for the original Macintosh. We then explored some more contemporary icon designers.

As before, please document your research using your Tumblr, hashtagging content for the module with your module code (#IXD104 or #DES107).

### Master-Apprentice 01

Tasks for this week:

- create your own icon set for your travel app.  
- Start to consider what your app will do will it be based around weather, city monuments, food, culture.  Because depending on what idea you have will need to create icons and illustrations accordingly.  
- A mind map will help with this.

### Week 03: Hand to Mouse

__16 February, 2018__

This week we introduced another topics for the semester: illustration.

We explored the work of a number of illustrators, looking at a range of illustration styles and exploring tools we might use to create illustrations. We also highlighted the work of some of our graduates who have gone on to establish successful careers as world-renowned illustrators.

### Master Apprentice 02
You have two taskks this week:

1.  Remake one of these cityscapes - using sketch or illustrator.  You can choose either two of these images:

1. [Amsterdam](https://www.dropbox.com/s/88sidsks0qd1hms/amsterdam_dribbble.png?dl=0)
2. [London](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nmmzqr936yojrs9/dribbbler_london.jpg?dl=0)
3. [Paris](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ovef20t9ndd8232/paris.png?dl=0)

2.  Paper prototype your app design onto a 6up.  So you can begin to understand how its layout and structure will look.  [Get your 6up here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jwrstc6v7yy8xao/6up.pdf?dl=0)

### Week 04: Illustrating Interfaces: Art In Action

__23 February, 2018__

This week we introduced Illustration in User Interface Design.

We explored thow that illustrations can play a vital role in user interface design and how they can make information and data easier to understand.  Not just fo pictures but for functional interfaces.

Take what you have learned from creating the travel icons and cityscapes and create your own mobile app.  It must include at least three screens:

+ Home (Launch Screen)
+ Pick a City
+ Detail of City (e.g. London)

----


### Week 05: Tying it All Together: Mobile Interfaces

__02 March, 2018__

This week its all about taking our illustration loveliness both icons and cityscapes and tying it all together to create a travel app design.   We will be considering mobile design principles, color and the size of thumbs.

### Week 08: Visualising Data 

__23 March, 2018__

This week we kicked off with the second and final set of content for the module, exploring visualising data.

We introduced infographics, exploring how – in an attention deficit culture – we need to condense information down into easy-to-parse visuals. We explored how infographics have evolved, particularly highlighting the fact that – in fact – infographics have been in use.

As before, please document your research using your Tumblr, hashtagging content for the module with your module code (#IXD104 or #DES107).

### Project 02 – Infographic / Data Visualisation

For your second project of the module we want you to create an infographic / data visualisation looking specifically at global population. Research the subject of data visualisation and infographics thoroughly before you start your own piece only then will you understand what needs done.

#### Useful Resources

**The following link will provide you with the data you need to create your project - [worldometers](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population)**

Don't feel you need to just stick to this site for information, you may need to spread your research further to gather all of the data you need to create your final piece.

What you include in your visualisation is up to you but bear in mind that this will make up 40% of your final module mark so it needs to be a substantial body of work. A few graphs and pie charts will not be enough.

Your infographic/visualisation could focus on the historical and future changes in population, geographical, economic, religious differences, it's up to you.

At this stage research the subject as much as you can to investigate different approaches to data visualisation.

A few contemporary visualisations worth checking out are:

- [tweetping.net](http://tweetping.net)
- [How Different Groups Spend Their Day](http://www.nytimes.com//interactive/2009/07/31/business/20080801-metrics-graphic.html?hp)
- [The New York Times Innovation Portfolio](innovate.whsites.net)

### Master Apprentice 04
Remake a pie chart - using sketch or illustrator.  You can choose either this [image](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t34ert3dq4y223n/pie-bar.png?dl=0) or this [image](https://www.dropbox.com/s/13k8ip6o18rts2u/pie-chart.png?dl=0).

Extra credit for doing extra pie charts.

### Week 11: The Art of Information

__27 April, 2018__

Making sense of data and the constant barrage of information we are subjected to on a daily basis is becoming the focus for many designers and developers who look to different methods and disciplines to help us understand and interact with this information.

Turning data into an art form, [Brendan Dawes](http://brendandawes.com) pushes the boundaries of data visualisation, creating images of great beauty and complexity from information.

Composer [JoAnn Kuchera-Morin](http://www.create.ucsb.edu/~musjkm), Professor of Media Arts and Technology has developed the [Allosphere Research Facility](http://www.allosphere.ucsb.edu). The Allosphere is an immersive environment where scientists, engineeers, designers, etc are able to explore complex data in a virtual 3D environment.

[Aaron Koblin](http://www.aaronkoblin.com/work.html), digital media artist and Creative Director of the Data Arts Team at Google is perhaps best known for his innovative uses of data visualisation and crowdsourcing.
