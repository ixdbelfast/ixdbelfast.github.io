IXD304 Creative Entrepreneurship
================================

This module introduces students to the ideas and principles, which underpin creative entrepreneurship, placing a heavy focus on the emerging and rapidly growing field of digital product design.

Through a focus on companies and individuals that have built digital products – from the very large (for example, global tools like Facebook and Twitter) to the very small (for example, sole designers developing products like icons and typefaces) – students are encouraged to develop an entrepreneurial mindset.

Week 01 – An Introduction to Entrepreneurship
---------------------------------------------

So, what makes an entrepreneur?

>"The critical ingredient is getting off your butt and doing something. It’s as simple as that. A lot of people have ideas, but there are few who decide to do something about them now. Not tomorrow. Not next week. But today. The true entrepreneur is a doer, not a dreamer.”
<cite>Nolan Bushnell, Entrepreneur</cite>

The term entrepreneur, in part has come to mean *someone who has his or her own startup or business*. The difference between an entrepreneur and a small business lies in the income generated. Where a small business may generate an income that may replace traditional employment an entrepreneur will generate substantial wealth. This wealth is often created much quicker than traditional business methods, five year span isn’t unusual. 

According to [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/aileron/2013/11/26/the-top-skills-every-entrepreneur-needs/#238a57ee5669), the skills every successful entrepreneur have in common are:
- **Resiliency** – The ability to weather the ups and downs 
- **Focus** - After setting a long term vision, knowing how to “laser focus” on the very next step to get closer to the ultimate goal.
- **Invest** - For the long-term. Most entrepreneurs are not patient and focus only on what comes next, rather than where the company needs to go. 
- **Find and manage people** - They need to learn to network to meet the right people.
- **Sell** - Every entrepreneur is a sales person whether they want to be or not. They are either selling their ideas, products or services to customers, investors or employees.
- **Learn** - Successful entrepreneurs realize they don’t know everything and the market is constantly changing. They stay up to date on new systems, technology, and industry trends.
- **Self-reflection** - Allow downtime to reflect on the past and plan for the future.
- **Self-reliance** - While there is a lot of help for the entrepreneur, in the end, they need to be resourceful enough to depend on themselves.

####Your home is on the web  
To get the best placements (and the best jobs when you graduate) you need to be able to present yourself as effectively as possible. One of the first places to start should be your website. Without a web presence you will be all but invisible.

####Learn from the professionals
The keyword here is *learn*. Look, but don’t copy, therein lies the road to a *lot* of trouble. We will look at issues around copyright and plagiarism in **Week 06 – Who Owns What** but in the meantime, feel free to draw inspiration from the resources you find but make sure your website is exactly that. 100% yours.

**We looked at:**

- [Personal Page by Naz Hamid](https://github.com/weightshift/The-Personal-Page)   
- [Fieldwork](http://madebyfieldwork.com) and
- [Marco Grimaldi](http://www.thenerodesign.com)

*Importantly **find your own inspiration** and preferably from places other than **One Page Love** or **Awwwards** or a Google search of the best portfolio sites of 2016. These sites, and lots like them, can be useful, but your site will just end up a clone of everyone elses. This is your time to shine, to show what makes you stand out from the crowd.

The [net awards](https://thenetawards.com/vote) is a great place to find real talent. Where categories such as [Young Designer of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/young-designer) and [Young Developer of the Year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/young-developer) celebrate the next generation of talent. Who knows, some of you could be here in time to come!

Week 02 – From Service to Product
---------------------------------

>"Your ideas need you to stop doing stuff that doesn’t matter. They need you to risk everything for them.” <cite>David Hieatt, Hiut Denim</cite>

Our industry is changing, designers are moving from the traditional model of design-as-a-service, to the development of digital products. This has seen many designers move from the reliance on regular client work to developing products that can generate a greater income than client work alone. 

This shift has seen the development of a multitude of products and services which have helped shape the way we consume content, connect with others, and lighten our own workloads.

Homegrown products have included [Danny Turley's](https://twitter.com/@dannyturley), [Performa Sports](http://performasports.com); [Kyle Gawley](https://twitter.com/@kylegawley) and [David Turner’s](https://twitter.com/@herrwulf), [Get Invited](https://getinvited.to) and [Alex Milne’s](https://twitter.com/_alexmilne), [Little Deli](http://littledeli.com)

Week 03 – The Creative Process 
------------------------------

>“Spend time falling in love with things that aren’t design, and let those things influence your work. Inspiration comes from everywhere and all good designers talk about how much they’re inspired by architecture, fine art, books, nature, etc.”
<cite>–Jessica Hische</cite>

The creative process is unique for everyone, there is no single formula for getting ‘into the zone’ and starting those creative juices flowing.

There are however a few things we can do to help. James Webb Young’s excellent little book, ‘A Technique for Producing Ideas’ sets out a process that can help us a develop our ideas.

He suggests:

- **1. Gather raw material** – Not just for the project in hand but gather material for everything that interests you. As Hische says in the quote above, ‘inspiration comes from everywhere’, so start gathering.
- **2. Digest what you have gathered** – Once you have exhausted your research, allow time for the material to assimilate.
- **3. Unconscious processing** – Sleep on it and allow your subconscious do the hard work for you.
- **4. Everything clicks into place** – As Young calls it “a-ha! moment” when your idea seemingly comes out of thin air.
- **5. Idea meets reality** – As Young puts it your idea meets “the cold, grey dawn of the morning after,” and has to face reality. This is when you can seek feedback from your peers to check how robust your idea is. 

Of course, on occasions it isn’t as straightworward as this, but over time, and with experience, things will start to click into place.

Establishing a habit that sets you up for creative work, can help get you in the right frame of mind more easily. This could be as simple as sitting at your desk, listening to your favourite music with a mug of coffee. For others it could start with a morning trip to the gym or walking the dog. 

Developing habits prior to starting work helps get the mind ready, it tells the brain, ‘now is the time for creativity, so let’s get on with it!’

Week 04 – Stand Out From The Crowd
----------------------------------

>"You can be stronger when you are not wanting it if you just do it out of love and trust, then that is when you find what you are looking for.”
<cite>–Samuel T Herring.</cite>

There are literally hundreds, perhaps thousands, of young and up-and-coming designers and developers emerging onto the jobs market every year. In today’s lecture, we asked what can you do to stand out from the crowd.

A common trait you’ll find in everyone else who’s successful, is that they’re building relationships, that’s through sharing and getting out there and meeting people. Attending events, being active on the web (Twitter, etc.) all counts. When someone you respect does something great take a few moments and Tweet, that all goes a long way and it’s a big part of being a good human. And there can never be enough of them.
