§1IXD302/DES310: Narrative and Storytelling
=========================================

---
# Module Hand In: Tuesday 8th May 2018 at noon.

Remember to put links to all deliverables in one post for the module on your tumblr blogs.  

## Deliverables

**1. Narrative Takhe Website**  
**2. Master Apprentice: Heroes and Villans Website**        
	 **- Include the Style Tiles, Moodboards, Typography Excercises**  
**3. Research: Tumblr Blog, Sketchbooks and Supporting Material including prototypes.**

---

Examining how storytelling can be used to enhance content, this module considers how concepts like art direction, pacing and narrative can be used to control the flow through information. Through the creation of a piece of narrative web-based content, students are taught the dynamics of design as it unfolds like a story, across frames and over time.

For a more in-depth explanation of the module’s intent, including recommended reading, read the [abbreviated module descriptor](http://ixdbelfast.org/curriculum/0002/01/02/narrative-and-storytelling.html). (This module is run concurrently for students on both the BDes (Hons) Interaction Design and BSc (Hons) Interactive Multimedia Design courses.)

Students are provided with an existing piece of content, which we have carefully developed to include a broad range of content types. Without the burden of having to generate content, they are encouraged to develop a single page web site, where the use of narrative and storytelling is brought to the fore. The content is sectioned, with various asides, maps and charts, allowing for considerable creative interpretation.

### Week 01: Introduction; Brief; HTML is a Design Element


We kick off the semester with a short refresher, stressing that HTML is a design element. This session is intended to ease students back into their second year, blowing off the cobwebs and reiterating what we covered in Year 1. It is particularly designed to pick up direct Year 2 entrants that might be missing core skills.

+ Introduction
  + Outline of the Module
  + Teaching Staff
  + Lecture Series Overview
  + Assessment and Deliverables: A note on the deliverables and amount of effort I’m expecting. (This is a 20 Credit module, which equates to 200 effort hours, excluding the lectures, that’s 176 hours of self-directed study.)
+ HTML is a Design Element

### Week 03: Single Page Showcase

A roundup of beautifully designed single page sites, to inspire. If you’re looking to level the big beasts, this is where you should be aiming. We’ll take a series of single page stories and break them down, exploring how narrative and pacing underpin their design.

+ Bird Inspiration
  + Classics
  + Young Pretenders
+ Portfolios
  + Get them to explore how others tell the story of their portfolio.
+ Side Projects

### Week 04: What Is Narrative? Learning From Print


Print’s not dead, far from it. It’s linear (and non-linear) and there’s a lot we can learn from it. In this lecture we explore the legacy of printed narratives, exploring books, magazines and other printed ephemera, where a story forms a backbone of the experience.

+ What is this thing called paper?
+ Getting inspiration off-screen.
+ Exemplars (Show and Tell):
  + Monocle
  + iD
  + Speak
  + Time Magazine
  + The Economist
+ How books function and tell stories.
  + Pacing
  + Choose Your Own Adventure

### Week 05: What Is Narrative? Learning From Music and Film

From Gorecki to Glass, Kurosawa to Kubrick, there’s a great deal we can learn from the worlds of music and film. In this lecture we introduce the idea of structure, rhythm and cadence, and the importance of considering the spaces within content journeys.

+ Exemplars (Show and Tell):
  + Kurosawa
  + Kubrik
  + Haneke
+ Structure
  + The Shape of Song
  + Verse Chorus Verse
  + The spaces between notes matter.
+ Pacing
  + East and West
  + The Power of the Pause
+ Colour

### Week 06: Group Critique

A group critique encouraging peer learning, this session affords an opportunity to gather feedback on the work done to date. Expect honest opinions, expressed fairly.

During the crit we'll be focusing on the following deliverables:

+ HTML and Semantics (Week 1)
+ Moodboards (Week 3)
+ Style Tiles (Week 3)
+ Typography (Week 5)

*Both for Master-Apprentice excercises and Bird Project

### Week 07: Visual Vocabulary: Flat → Skeuomorphic → Flat…

We were unable to deliver this lecture as it fell on a designated reading day but for those interested in skeuomorphic to flat design the following material will provide a solid overview.

Let’s explore how our visual vocabularly has evolved. Once it was flat, then it became skeuomorphic (allowing the language of the real world to inform our understanding of new, emerging devices), now it’s flat again. We’ll explore the past and current landscape, including Google’s Material Design and IBM’s new IBM Design Language.

### Week 08: Moving From A → B: Designing Transitions

How we move from A → B matters. Animation can play an important part in the story. Do we use a dissolve? A Magic Move? In this lecture we’ll investigate transitions between states and explore Keynote as a rapid prototyping tool for designing interactions.

+ Transitions
  + Fade
  + Dissolve
  + Jump Cut
  + Etc.
+ How do the transitions we choose shape understanding and shape the form?
+ Timing

### Week 09: The Wonderful World of Maps

Returning to the content supplied (which includes a map) we ask: Why use a static map when we can learn all about the wonderful world of APIs? 

We’ll explore the Google Maps API and OpenStreetMap, encouraging the you to delve a little deeper and extend your skillset.

### Week 10: Amplifying Data


When designing with data, we have an opportunity to amplify that data through the careful use of design. In this lecture we explore charting libraries to present complex statistics elegantly and effectively. We’ll explore Chart.js and Google Charts, encouraging the students to add a new skill to their existing toolbox.

### Week 11: Optimising for Performance




We’re designing for everyone, regardless of their bandwidth. Let’s stop lazily designing for fat broadband pipes and start thinking of those with less capable connections. Those on mobile, those travelling on limited bandwidth, those less fortunate than us in the developed world. Let’s optimise, relentlessly.
