IXD302/DES310: Deliverables
===========================

This page is designed to give you a clear breakdown of the deliverables expected for the module. There are two deliverables:

+ Deliverable 1 - Narrative Web Site (60%)
+ Deliverable 2 - Master-Apprentice: Responsive Storytelling (40%)

The expectation is that the prototypes you create for Deliverable 2, will inform your final design for Deliverable 1.

Students are provided with an existing piece of content, which I have carefully developed to include a broad range of content types. Without the burden of having to generate content, they are encouraged to develop a single page web site, where the use of narrative and storytelling is brought to the fore. The content is sectioned, with various asides, maps and charts, allowing for considerable creative interpretation.

Deliverable 1 - Narrative Web Site (60%)
----------------------------------------

Using your prototypes as a starting point, this is your opportunity to consider how everything fits together as a piece of narrative design.

We are looking for creative solutions. Consider this an opportunity to showcase your skills and create a substantial portfolio piece that you can use to secure a placement.



Deliverable 2 - Master-Apprentice: Responsive Storytelling (40%)
--------------------------------

We are expecting a number of Master-Apprentice Lessons, as detailed below. For each deliverable I’ve supplied links to content that you might find useful to enable you to deliver what is expected. These links will be added after we have covered them in the lectures.
