IXD101 Deliverables
===========================

This page is designed to give you a clear breakdown of the deliverables expected for the module. Deliverables for this module are broken into two main sections with a series of weekly deliverables for each section.



## Week 01-05 Paper
Paper-based exercises introduce fundamental design principles developed at the Bauhaus, Ulm School of Design, and beyond. The following content outlines the weekly deliverables for workshop material and homework

### Week 01 - Deliverable 01 Dot 
- Workshop paper exercises worked with 1, 2, 3, and 5 dots
- The first homework deliverable is to create a background screen for your smartphone using nothing but dots and circles. Try to avoid colour as much as possible.  
Grab the [Grid PDF](resources/twenty_squares.pdf) to add your 50 dots on your laptop.


### Week 02 - Deliverable 02 Line 
- Workshop paper exercises worked with 1, 2, 3, 5 and 50 lines
- This weeks homework deliverable is to create a background screen for your laptop using nothing but lines. Again, try to avoid colour as much as possible.  


### Week 03 - Deliverable 03 Plane  
- Workshop deliverable to 1, 2, 3 and 9 planes + tone and a more finely executed 9 planes tone piece (you can use Illustrator or Sketch for this one if you wish). 
- The homework exercise for this week is to create a modular typeface built from planes. [Fontstruct](http://fontstruct.com) is an excellent tool to help you do this. Alternatively you could use Sketch or Illustrator.


### Week 04 - Deliverable 04 Type 
- Continue with your 1 'M' six ways, your two letters joined six ways, and your kerning exercise. 
- Homework – in addition to these, this weeks task is to create three minimal movie posters in the style of [Josef Müller Brockmann](http://print-process.com/product/?product-id=1052). This - [JMB on Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/eleventhirty/jmb/) might also be useful

## Week 06-8 HTML
**Using the story of John Baskerville as a starting point, the screen-based exercises will ground students with a solid understanding of HTML5 and CSS3, the building blocks of web-based content.**

### Week 06 - HTML 101 
- Taking the raw [Brief History of Type](resources/brief-history-of-type.txt) text as your starting point create a simple HTML5 page on GitHub. There is a [visual guide](resources/html-01-make-this.jpg) to help you work this out. Save this as **history1.html**
- The [John Baskerville text](resources/john-baskerville.txt) can be found here.



### Week 08 - Lists and Links
- Add a nested, unordered list and save as **baskerville2.html** and secondly add a simple navigation linking this with anchors to each section. Finally add an email link and an absolute link to an external website. Save this as **baskerville2.html**
 
#### Homework
Download the [attached file](resources/homework2.zip), add a nav element to the top of your page and linked anchors as shown on the file "make-this-index-03.png". You should also create a separate file named "history-list.html" and recreate the file "make-this-list.png" from the supplied list.md file.

### Week 09 – Introducing Tables and Inserting Images
- Deliverable 08 HTML** – This week you should have created two versions. The should replace your unordered list with a table while the second version should include properly optimised images. The images can be found in the [resources folder](resources/unedited-images) on GitHub.
 
#### Homework
 - Change your type history list into a table, this [table sample](resources/make-this-table.png) Then add and optimise the images found in "unedited-images" in the "resources" folder
 - This week you should check your previous John Baskerville HTML files to make sure you have markedup your text correctly. Make sure you use an [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to ensure your markup is correct.
 - In addition, you should incorporate your type history table with your main [Brief History of Type](resources/make-this-index.png) page (don't forget to include your images).

## Week 09–12 CSS
### Week 10 – CSS 101
- This week we started to look at CSS and applied some design to our well structured markup. Save this as version 6/7 (or whichever number you’re currently at) and upload it to your GitHub site.
- Make a copy of your last **Type History HTML** file and apply the CSS styling covered at today’s workshop. You should play around with the colour (color in CSS), type hierarchy and measure (page width) to get a feel for how these work.

<!-- 
### Week 11 – Web Fonts
- This week we continued our exploration into CSS and looked at web typography in a little more detail. For this weeks version of the History of Type exercise add Google fonts of your own choice and save this as the next version. Please make sure you choose fonts appropriate to the content.
- This week we have an additional exercise, we would like to you take this [Typographic Exercise](resources/make_this_css.png) – and, using css, style it as closely as you can to the image in the link. To make it a little easier you can use this [simple HTML page](resources/cssbaskerville.html) to start you off.

The fonts used in this exercise are all [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com):
- Libre Baskerville
- Open Sans
- Arvo

You can use these or choose your own but please make sure you use serif, san-serif (or slab-serif) fonts.
<!-- 
### Week 12 – Media Queries, Transitions and Flexbox
– This week we finished off with a look at a lot of material from media queriesto background images, dropshadows to kerning and transitions to flexbox. 
<!-- 
Finish off your introduction with the inclusion of some of the features covered this week. At the very least you could add some transitions to your links to provide some subtle user feedback. 
<!-- 
You can check out my own versions on [GitHub](https://github.com/eleventhirty/john_baskerville) for reference. It would be very easy to just copy these but this won’t teach you how to implement them properly to your own work. Using these as reference and recreating them yourselves will help you retain the information much more readily.
