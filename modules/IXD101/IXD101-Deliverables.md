IXD101 Deliverables
===========================

This page is designed to give you a clear breakdown of the deliverables expected for the module. Deliverables for this module are broken into two main sections with a series of weekly deliverables for each section.



##Week 01-05 Paper 
Paper-based exercises introduce fundamental design principles developed at the Bauhaus, Ulm School of Design, and beyond.  

**Week 02 - Deliverable 01 Dot** - Along with your paper exercises working with 1, 2, 3, 5 and 50 dots this weeks deliverable is to create a background screen for your smartphone using nothing but dots and circles. Try to avoid colour as much as possible.
 
Grab the [Grid PDF](resources/squares.pdf) to add your 50 dots on your laptop.

**Week 03 - Deliverable 02 Line** - Along with your paper exercises working with 1, 2, 3, 5 and 50 lines this weeks deliverable is to create a background screen for your laptop using nothing but lines. Again, try to avoid colour as much as possible.  


**Week 04 - Deliverable 03 Plane** – Continue with your 1, 2, 3 and 9 planes + tone and a more finely executed 9 planes + tone piece. 

The final exercise for this week is to create a modular typeface built from planes. [Fontstruct](http://fontstruct.com) is an excellent tool to help you do this. Alternatively you could use Sketch or Illustrator.

**Week 05 - Deliverable 04 Type** – Continue with your 1 'M' six ways, your two letters joined six ways and your kerning exercise. In addition to these, this weeks task is to create a movie poster in the style of [Josef Müller Brockmann](http://print-process.com/product/?product-id=1052). This - [JMB on Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/eleventhirty/jmb/) might also be useful.





##Week 06-12 Screen
###HTML
Using the story of John Baskerville as a starting point the screen-based exercises will ground students with a solid understanding of HTML5 and CSS3, the building blocks of web-based content.

**Week 06 - Deliverable 06 HTML** – Taking the raw [Brief History of Type](resources/brief-history-of-type.txt) text as your starting point create a simple HTML5 page on GitHub. There is a [visual guide](resources/html-01-make-this.png) to help you work this out. Save this as history1.html

The [John Baskerville text](resources/john-baskerville.txt.zip) can be found here.

**Week 07 - Deliverable 07 HTML** – Add a nested, unordered list and save as version2.html and secondly add a simple navigation linking this with anchors to each section. Finally add an email link and an absolute link to an external website. Save this as version3.html
  
####Homework
Download the [attached file](resources/homework2.zip), add a nav element to the top of your page and linked anchors as shown on the file "make-this-index-03.png". You should also create a separate file named "history-list.html" and recreate the file "make-this-list.png" from the supplied list.md file.

 - **Week 08 - Deliverable 08 HTML** – This week you should have created two versions. The should replace your unordered list with a table while the second version should include properly optimised images.
 
 ####Homework
 Change your type history list into a table, this [table sample](resources/make-this-table.png) Then add and optimise the images found in "unedited-images" in the "resources" folder
 
 - **Week 09 - Deliverable 09 HTML – This week you should check your previous John Baskerville HTML files to make sure you have markedup your text correctly. In addition, you should incorporate your type history table with your main [Brief History of Type](resources/make-this-index.png) page (don't forget to include your images).

###CSS
 - **Week 10 - Deliverable 10 HTML** – This week we started to look at CSS and applied some design to our well structured markup. Save this as version 6/7 (or whichever number you’re currently at) and upload it to your GitHub site.
- Make a copy of your last Type History HTML file and apply the CSS styling covered at today’s workshop. You should play around with the colour (color in CSS), type hierarchy and measure (page width) to get a feel for how these work.


- **Week 11 – Deliverable 10 HTML** – This week we continued our exploration into CSS and looked at web typography in a little more detail introduced a few media queries. Add the Google font – Libre Baskerville – and save this as the next version.

- This week we have an additional exercise. We would like to you take this [Typographic Exercise](resources/week-11-make-this.png) – and, using css, style it as closely as you can to the image in the link.

The fonts used in this erercise are all Google fonts:
- Libre Baskerville
- Open Sans
- Arvo

You can use these or choose your own but please make sure you use serif, san-serif and slab-serif fonts.

- **Week 12 – Deliverable 11 HTML** – To finish this section off we would like you to take what you have learnt this semester and redesign your **Hello World** page. This will, for some of you, be your first solid presence online and should be a means to show off what you know and what you have created. -->
