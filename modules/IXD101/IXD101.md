IXD101 – Interaction Design Fundamentals
========================================

Placing a heavy emphasis on a design-focussed approach towards interaction design, this module introduces the fundamentals of the craft of communication design, both off- and on-screen. Through a combination of core analogue (drawing, making) and digital (HTML, CSS) skills, students are equipped with the tools required to practice in today’s interaction design industry.

For a more in-depth explanation of the module’s intent, including recommended reading, read the [abbreviated module descriptor](http://ixdbelfast.org/curriculum/0001/01/01/interaction-design-fundamentals.html). (This module is run concurrently for students on both the BDes (Hons) Interaction Design and BSc (Hons) Interactive Multimedia Design courses.)

Supporting material for IXD101 will be posted here on an ongoing basis. If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, don't worry, we will be introducing you to its magic at the end of Week 03.

GitHub can all appear a little intimidating at first, but – like anything in life – with some experience it will all make sense. Don't worry, we won't leave you in the dark, we're here to help and will ensure you're all set to go. For now you can just keep this page bookmarked and read it like any other web page.

Week 01 – Point
---------------

To kick things off we stressed the importance of working on paper:

> Paper should be the first point of call to get your idea(s) out of your head and into a form that can be easily visualised, reimagined, discussed and shared.
> —Jake Giltsoff, Typekit

> [Always start on paper.](http://www.leemunroe.com/designing-with-pen-paper/)
> —Lee Munroe, Mailgun

> When we jump straight onto the computer and begin pushing pixels around in Photoshop (or our weapon of choice), we’re jumping several stages ahead in the process, without any of the foundational stages that go before it. As a result, we’ll likely find that problems arrive that would’ve been foreseen if we’d only gone through a bit of research and discovery first — some sketching, some loose ideas. The best designs come at the end of a process, and that process begins with rough experimentation with lo-fi tools.
> —Elliot Jay Stocks, Typekit



###Resources

Each week I will add a list of suitable resources some will have been covered during the day but others may be added where appropriate. Depending on what's available these may be links to books, publications, websites or videos.

[If the Moon Were Only 1 Pixel](http://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html)

Check out the Moving Brands [Wikipedia "Living Mark"](http://www.movingbrands.com/work/wikipedia-an-mb-internal-project) project. Pay particular attention to the amount of research they employed during the development of the brand.

[Teaching to See](http://teachingtosee.org/film/TeachingToSee.html)


We’re starting with the smallest possible building block – the point – we’ll use this across a range of exercises on paper that investigate and explore form and composition.

>“Point, line, and plane are the building blocks of design. From these elements, designers create images, icons, textures, patterns, diagrams, animations, and typographic systems.” Ellen Lupton

Luptons book [Graphic Design, The New Basics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Graphic-Design-The-New-Basics/dp/1568987021) takes us back to the roots of design and asks designers to take a fresh look at the discipline while Christian Lebourg’s [Visual Grammar](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Visual-Grammar-Design-Briefs-Christian/dp/1568985819/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1443441634&sr=8-1&keywords=Visual+Grammar) asks us to learn and understand the basics for a better understanding of the graphics that bombard us every day.

We took a look at [Sagmeister Walsh Seed](http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/work/project/seed-logo/) branding and how simple dots can become a highly creative and very flexible brand. Alternatively, [Nicholas Felton](http://feltron.com) shows the value circles add to the creation of his personal annual reports.

### What Do I need?

Continue with your 1, 2, 3 and 5 and making sure you complete each before moving onto the next. Then create a background for your mobile using nothing but circles. Try to avoid colour, we will be looking at this in good time.

Get a [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com) account. It’s free and this is where you will post your work for assessment over the coming weeks.

You should also look at setting up a [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/tour/0) account. The first 2GB are free and you can earn more space through referrals. Dropbox has become an invaluable tool for designers allowing them to share and access material wherever they are.

### Sketch

[Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) is one of the leading applications for interaction designers, and well worth getting to grips with.

There are tonnes of tutorials online which will take you through all aspects of this excellent package. Our introduction looked at creating a simple [calendar icon](http://medialoot.com/blog/how-to-create-a-calendar-icon-using-bohemian-coding-sketch).

There are lots more to accommodate all types of designer with [CSS Author](http://www.cssauthor.com/best-sketch-tutorials-video-article) providing a handy list of some of the best.

To help you get to grips with the app a little more run through this [Prescription Bottle Ilustration](https://medium.com/sketch-tricks/sketch-tutorial-create-a-simple-illustration-of-prescription-bottle-in-sketch-f3c66faf76e6#.jg6m61w91) try to personalise it a little and post the result on Tumblr.
