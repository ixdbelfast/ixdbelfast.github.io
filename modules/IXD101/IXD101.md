IXD101 – Interaction Design Fundamentals
========================================

Placing a heavy emphasis on a design-focussed approach towards interaction design, this module introduces the fundamentals of the craft of communication design, both off- and on-screen. Through a combination of core analogue (drawing, making) and digital (HTML, CSS) skills, students are equipped with the tools required to practice in today’s interaction design industry.

For a more in-depth explanation of the module’s intent, including recommended reading, read the [abbreviated module descriptor](http://ixdbelfast.org/curriculum/0001/01/01/interaction-design-fundamentals.html). (This module is run concurrently for students on both the BDes (Hons) Interaction Design and BSc (Hons) Interactive Multimedia Design courses.)

Supporting material for IXD101 will be posted here on an ongoing basis. If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, don't worry, we will be introducing you to its magic at the end of Week 03.

GitHub can all appear a little intimidating at first, but – like anything in life – with some experience it will all make sense. Don't worry, we won't leave you in the dark, we're here to help and will ensure you're all set to go. For now you can just keep this page bookmarked and read it like any other web page.

Week 01 – The Adventure Ahead
-----------------------------

In this, our first week, we welcomed you to our exciting adventure ahead. Our presentations were as follows:

+ The Adventure Ahead
+ A Show and Tell: Meet Mr Murphy
+ Good Ideas Grow on Paper

Monday's session stressed the importance of working on paper:

> Paper should be the first point of call to get your idea(s) out of your head and into a form that can be easily visualised, reimagined, discussed and shared.
> —Jake Giltsoff, Typekit

> [Always start on paper.](http://www.leemunroe.com/designing-with-pen-paper/)
> —Lee Munroe, Mailgun

> When we jump straight onto the computer and begin pushing pixels around in Photoshop (or our weapon of choice), we’re jumping several stages ahead in the process, without any of the foundational stages that go before it. As a result, we’ll likely find that problems arrive that would’ve been foreseen if we’d only gone through a bit of research and discovery first — some sketching, some loose ideas. The best designs come at the end of a process, and that process begins with rough experimentation with lo-fi tools.
> —Elliot Jay Stocks, Typekit

Next up we had a full day paper prototyping workshop.

Week 02 – Point
---------------

We're starting with the smallest possible building block – the point – we'll use this across a range of exercises on paper that investigate and explore form and composition.

>Point, line, and plane are the building blocks of design. From these elements, designers create images, icons, textures, patterns, diagrams, animations, and typographic systems.” Ellen Lupton

Luptons book [Graphic Design, The New Basics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Graphic-Design-The-New-Basics/dp/1568987021) takes us back to the roots of design and asks designers to take a fresh look at the discipline while Christian Lebourg's [Visual Grammar](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Visual-Grammar-Design-Briefs-Christian/dp/1568985819/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1443441634&sr=8-1&keywords=Visual+Grammar) asks us to learn and understand the basics for a better understanding of the graphics that bombard us every day.

We took a look at [Sagmeister Walsh Seed](http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com/work/project/seed-logo/) branding and how simple dots can become a highly creative and very flexible brand. Alternatively, [Nicholas Felton](http://feltron.com) shows the value circles add to the creation of his personal annual reports.

###What Do I need?

Continue with your 1,2,3,5 and 50 points and making sure you complete each before moving onto the next. Then create a background for your mobile using nothing but circles. Try to avoid colour, we will be looking at this in good time.

Get a [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com) account. It’s free and this is where you will post your work for assessment over the coming weeks.

You should also look at setting up a [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/tour/0) account. The first 2GB are free and you can earn more space through referrals. Dropbox has become an invaluable tool for designers allowing them to share and access material wherever they are.

###Sketch Tutorial

[Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) is one of the leading applications for interaction designers, and well worth getting to grips with.

There are tonnes of tutorials online which will take you through all aspects of this excellent package. Our introduction looked at creating a simple [calendar icon](http://medialoot.com/blog/how-to-create-a-calendar-icon-using-bohemian-coding-sketch).

There are lots more to accommodate all types of designer with [CSS Author](http://www.cssauthor.com/best-sketch-tutorials-video-article) providing a handy list of some of the best.

To help you get to grips with the app a little more run through this [Prescription Bottle Ilustration](https://medium.com/sketch-tricks/sketch-tutorial-create-a-simple-illustration-of-prescription-bottle-in-sketch-f3c66faf76e6#.jg6m61w91) try to personalise it a little and post the result on Tumblr.

---

Week 03 – Line
--------------

This week we progressed to working with lines. 

We looked at examples from [Brendan Dawes](http://www.brendandawes.com) and I had mentioned some of the work our very own Christopher Murphy created with his record label [Fallt](http://www.fallt.com). 

We also looked at Moving Brands vision for [HP](http://imjustcreative.com/hp-rebrands-adopts-a-minimal-approach-by-moving-brands/2011/12/14). And had mentioned UnderConsideration's [Brand New](http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/a_new_hp_so_close_yet_so_far_away.php#.VhKHeBNViko) as a valuable resource for brand work discussion.

We touched on [Richard Chartier’s](https://richardchartier.bandcamp.com) work and also took a look at the [Air Lines](http://www.lx97.com/maps) poster.

Edward Tufte’s excellent movie about Inga Druckery’s [Teaching to See](http://teachingtosee.org/film/TeachingToSee.html) takes a look at the art of close observation. 

####What Do I need?

Continue with your 1,2,3,5 and 50 line exercises and make sure you complete each before moving onto the next. Then create a background for your laptop using nothing but lines. Try to avoid colour, we will be looking at this in good time.

Don't forget to keep posting your research material, development work and final pieces to your Tumblr account

---

Week 04 – Plane
---------------

This week we extended our visual vocabulary by looking at the plane. Examples included [Josef Müller Brockmann](https://www.flickr.com/photos/blankaposters/sets/72157605199393277), [Wim Crouwel](http://www.iconofgraphics.com/wim-crouwel) and Mark Blamire’s work as [Blanka](https://www.flickr.com/photos/blankaposters). Don’t just check the links above, try to find out as much as you can about these people. The library will have material and there will be lots more online.

Covering modular typefaces we took a look at the work of Emigre co-founder [Zuzana Licko](http://www.emigre.com/Bios.php?d=10) and another look at Wim Crouwel, particularly his [New Alphabet](http://www.moma.org/collection/works/139322). The man is a legend. 

This great great example of a modular typeface in [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/Modular-free-Typeface-GADO/7343401) starts with the building blocks and illustrates how four simple shapes can create a very versatile typeface. 

So as you can see you can do a huge amount with very simple shapes. Now it's up to you.

Continue with your 1, 2, 3 and 9 planes + tone and a more finely executed 9 planes + tone piece. 

The final exercise for this week is to create a modular typeface built from planes. [Fontstruct](http://fontstruct.com) is an excellent tool to help you do this. Alternatively you could use Sketch or Illustrator.

 Week 05 – Typography
--------------------

The letter, the word, the sentence, the paragraph, the page: These are the building blocks of typography. This week we'll begin to explore typography, working from the letter to the page. We'll be covering the fundamentals of typography, content that will serve you well in your future careers.

In an excellent article titled [Web Design is 95% Typography](http://ia.net/blog/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period/) iA’s Oliver Reichenstein stated:

> 95% of the information on the web is written language. It is only logical to say that a web designer should get good training in the main discipline of shaping written information, in other words: Typography.

Today we’ll only uncover the tip of the typographic iceberg. The importance of typography can't be stressed enough, it is the backbone of almost everything we do. We’ll be working through a series of staged exercises, as we have in previous weeks, but I’d strongly suggest you explore some of the content we’ve linked to below. Start with [Typekit Practice](http://practice.typekit.com), courtesy of Tim Brown and the folks at Typekit, it's a very good resource and is growing over time.

[Typekit](http://typecast.com) is an excellent source of fonts for web and desktop. If you have Adobe CC you will already have access to type kit. If not you can use two families of fonts for free or for around £30.00 you can have access to over 1,000 fonts. Also worth signing up for is Monotype's [Typecast](http://typecast.com), this will allow you to work out layouts for web pages and will give you access to a wide range of paid-for and free fonts.

I’d also strongly recommend that you get at least a couple of the books below. There are hundreds of books on typography, if you’re just embarking on your journey I’d strongly recommend Erik Spiekermann’s [Stop Stealing Sheep](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321934288/monographic-21), it's a very good primer. Ellen Lupton's [Thinking With Type](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1568989695/monographic-21) is also excellent.

Week 05b – Colour
----------------

Colour can be used in many different ways in design. It can highlight specific information that might otherwise be lost, it can alert us to things we should be aware of or it can offer direction.

We looked at a number of examples where designers used colour as the primary means of communication.
- [alorenz](http://www.alorenz.net)
- [Josef Müller Brockmann](http://ilovetypography.com/2013/01/12/a-firm-turn-toward-the-objective-josef-muller-brockmann-1948-1981). We also looked at Brockmann’s use of the grid in his work.
- [MuirMcNeil](http://www.muirmcneil.com)

There are numerous online resources to help us choose our colour palettes. Notable sites are:

- [Adobe Color CC](https://color.adobe.com)
- [COLOURlovers](http://www.colourlovers.com)
- [Color](http://color.hailpixel.com)

Week 06 – An Introduction to HTML pt1
-------------------------------------


Today we looked at an introduction to HTML (HyperText Markup Language), by first taking a look back through the past 26 years of the world wide web, from the [first web page](http://info.cern.ch) to inventor [Sir Tim Berners-Lee](http://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web) original proposal for the web to what it has become today.

We took a brief look at the development of the [web browser](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/microsoft/11577364/Web-browsers-a-brief-history.html) and the chaos that ensued, to the establishment of the [Web Standards Project](http://www.webstandards.org) and the move towards a open and accessible web.

We covered [Web Standards](http://www.w3.org/standards) – what they are and why should we care, HTML Tags and page structure and HTML5, the latest spec to become a [W3C official standard](http://www.w3.org).

###John Baskerville

We kicked off the John Baskerville project which will run over the next six weeks introducing you to HTML3 and CSS3. Most of you will have access to the HTML5 template to get you started but if you need a copy you can find it here: [HTML5 Template](https://github.com/ixdbelfast/ixdbelfast.github.io/tree/master/modules/IXD101/resources)

 Week 07 – Introduction to HTML #2
----------------------------------

Today’s class focussed on lists and links. 

###Lists

To kick things off we looked at ordered `<ol>` and unordered – `<ul>` lists where:

`<ol>`
    
    <li>first item</li>
    
    <li>second item</li>
    
    <li>third item</li>
    
`<ol>`

would be displayed as:

1. first item
2. second item
3. third item

and 

`<ul>`
    
    <li>first item</li>
    
    <li>second item</li>
    
    <li>third item</li>
    
`<ul>`

would be displayed as:

- first item
- second item
- third item

and nested lists would be created like:

`<ul>`

  `<li>first item</li>`
  
  `<li>second item`  – Look, the closing `</li>` tag is not placed here!
  
   ` <ol>`
   
      <li>second item first subitem</li>
      
      <li>second item second subitem</li>
      
      <li>second item third subitem</li>
      
    </ol>
    
  `</li>`  –   Here is the closing `</li>` tag 
  
 ` <li>third item</li>`
 
`</ul>`

The markup above would be displayer in the browser like this:

- first item
- second item
     1. second item first subitem
     2. second item second subitem
     3. second item third subitem
- third item


The following list should be added an a nested, unordered list to the end of 'The Typeface' section of your first HTML version and saved as version 2

- **Hot type**
    - Deberny & Peignot
    - Fry Foundry
    - American Type Founders
    - Linotype
    - Lanston Monotype

- **Cold type**
    - Autologic
    - Berthold
    - Compugraphic
    - Hell AG
    - Monotype

- **Digital type**
    - Linotype
    - URW++
    - Monotype
    - Bitstream
    
    
###Hyperlinks    

The second half of today’s class looked at links starting off with a look at the general structure then focussing on a number of the different types of links you are likely to encounter.

A typical [absolute](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/absolute-link) link would look like this:

`<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDb</a>`

Here, **a**, the anchor element defines a hyperlink to a location either on the same page or elsewhere on the web and the **href** specifies the links destination.

The text held between **>IMDb<** would appear as the link – [IMDb](http://www.imdb.com) – on the web page.

The overview of a directory structure was quite complex but to help you understand this a little more fully this – [Organising a Website](http://www.htmlquick.com/tutorials/organizing-website.html) – overview should clarify things.

We looked at linking within our Baskerville page using anchors. First creating a list within the newly introduced `<nav>` element:

`<nav>`

`<ul>`

`<li><a href="#the-man">The Man</a></li>`

`<li><a href="#the-typeface">The Typeface</a></li>`

`<li><a href="#mrs-eaves">Mrs Eaves</a></li>`

`</ul>`

`</nav>`

Then we added an **id** to our section titles to allow us to link the simple navigation to each chapter

`<h2 id="the-typeface">The Typeface</h2>`

We also looked at mail links with:

`<a href="mailto:p.mccormack.ac.uk" title="Feel free to send me an email">Get in touch</a>`

Where adding **mailto:** then the email address you want to link to will allow you to include direct email links. Here the title atribute isn’t entirely necessary but it can act as a useful signpost or call to action.

---

08 – Working Images and Tables
------------------------------------

This week kicked off with a recap on the previous weeks look at lists and links we also introduced a few new elements namely:

- `<dl>``<dt>`and `<dd>` in plain language definitation list, definitation term and definitation data. These are explained in Mozilla's very useful [HTML Element Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dl) section.
- `<br/>` the use carefully line break element.
and
- `<hr/>` the often useful horizontal rule element.

###Tables

A large focus of the mornings session focussed on building tables, no not the IKEA type but those of the much maligned HTML variety. There's no denying tables have had a bad press but, used properly – that is, not to build an entire website with – they still have their place.

So quicker than you can erect an [Ingatorp](http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/80221427) we changed last weeks nested list into a table using:

- `<table>` – simple, it lets the browser to expect the following content to be laid out as a table. 
- `<caption>` – placed directly after the `<table>` element it allows for the addition of a title caption if required.

Next we looked at:
- `<tr>`, `<th>` and `<td>` – table row, table head and table data. You can find explanations of these and more once again on Mozilla's [HTML Element Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table)

Working through our oroginal Baskerville list we rebuilt it into a useful table:

`<table >`

      <caption>Foundries that offer versions of Baskerville</caption>
      
         <tr>
         
           <th>Hot type</th>
           
           <th>Cold type</th>
                    
            <th>Digital type</th>
                    
         </tr>
         
          <tr>
         
           <td>Deberny & Peignot</td>
           
           <td>Autologic</td>
                    
            <td>Linotype</td>
                    
         </tr>
`</table>`

…and so on, which resulted in something like this:

|  Hot type |  Cold type |  Digital type |   
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Deberny & Peignot|  Autologic | Linotype  |   
|  Fry Foundry | Berthold  |  URW++ |   
|  American Type Founders |  Compugraphic | Monotype  |   
|  Linotype | Hell AG  |  Bitstream |
|  Lanston Monotype | Monotype  |      |

###Images

The second half of the day looked at image types, optimisation and how to add them to the Baskerville page.

We started off looking at the difference between a jpg, gif, png and svg.

This [useful infographic](http://www.whoishostingthis.com/blog/2014/12/06/jpeg-gif-png) will outine the differences and applications for jpg, gif and png’s. This. [Ultimate Guide to SVG](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2015/01/the-ultimate-guide-to-svg) will tell you everything you need to know about svg’s.

Week 10 – CSS101
----------------

Now we have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of markup, it’s time to start to apply some design aesthetics to out text and images. 

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used to control the presentation of documents written in markup language, for example, to style web pages written in HTML. 

Where HTML gives our content semantic meaning, CSS dresses this content and allows us to control the layout of the page. CSS can be used to define colours, fonts, and a variety of other aspects of document presentation; it can also be used to position elements and control layout across the multitude of web-enabled devices that inhabit our lives. 

Up until this point our well-structured web pages have been styled using the browser’s default stylesheet. Although these stylesheets vary slightly between browsers, they have common characteristics including black text, blue text for links, and purple text for visited links. By adding our own stylesheet, we can override the browser’s default stylesheet, allowing us to style the page as we wish. 

So why bother with CSS if our websites can already be viewed as plain HTML pages? Well, CSS allows us to make our content more visually appealing, it gives a website an identity, differentiating it from others making it memorable. It also makes content easily digestible when consideration is given to the treatment of typography.

It would take a separate website to run through everything we need to cover for CSS but luckly others have done the job for us. The links in **Resources** below will take you through a number of useful books and websites that should prove invaluable.

In addition to a general introduction to CSS we looked at **Common Typographic Errors** and how we should fix them. Today’s web provides the designer with much more typographic freedom from early days of restricted, standard system font sets. Nowadays we have access to a growing range of web fonts, we can include ligatures, add font variants, kern our type, add swashes and much more. 

Christopher Murphy along with Typekit designer, Jake Giltsoff, took the Baskerville project to a wider audience via an excellent [**net magazine article**](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/create-beautiful-web-typography-111517663).  This looked at how many of the finer aspects of the text could and should be presented. 

Taking this a little step further we looked at how these finer details can be presented with some additional HTML and CSS. So, in no particular order:

####Puncutation

- ###Baskerville's work

- Notice anything wrong with the text above? No? The sharper eyed will notice that the apostrophe is wrong. What we see here, and commonly see in many cases, is a [Prime](https://printingpartners.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/the-apostrophe-prime-acute-double-prime-and-quotation-mark) which is the completely wrong character. On many occasions it’s enough to use the standard keyboard symbol. On a Apple keyboard this can be found by pressing the **alt + shift + right curly bracket keys** – ’ or you could also use `&rsquo;` or `&#8217;` – an [HTML character code](http://www.ascii.cl/htmlcodes.htm), to make sure it works across all browsers (if you have to work with a lot of text this last approach can become very time consuming) but generally we are pretty safe to use the standard keyboard form. So the end result should look like – 

- ###Baskerville’s work…


- We can see the same issue here – **"Having been an early admirer of the…proportion."** where the quitation has used a double prime instead of proper double quotation marks. These can be found by typing **alt + shift + left curly bracket** for – **”** and **alt + left curly bracket** for – **“**. Once again there are alternative HTML codes for both – **&ldquo;** and **rdqou;** for those instances where the standard symbol doesn’t work.

Chris and Jake’s piece [MacroMicroTypography](http://macromicrotypo.com/walkthrough) walks you through the most common typographic issues. Please make sure to read through it to fully understand some of the finer details of typographic control.

 Week 11 – Adding Flexibility
----------------------------

This week we looked at:
- The Box Model
- The Reset
- The Viewport
- Media Queries

####The Box Model
As discussed different HTML elements are looked upon as boxes in the browser. In CSS, the term **box model** is used when we talk about the design and layout of the page.

The [CSS box model](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp) is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element which  consists of &mdash; margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

####The Reset
The reset strips away browser inconsistencies allowing us to work from a common baseline. The best know it perhaps that from [Eric Meyer](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset)

####Viewport
The viewport is the user’s visible area of a web page, on a smartphone it will be obviously smaller than that of a laptop.

HTML5 allows us to take control over the viewport, through the <meta> tag by:

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`

There are alternative methods which you can find on the ever useful [w3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp) website.

####Media Queries
Media queries consist of a media type ie `@media (max-width: 30em)`and at least one expression that limits the style sheets rules by using specific media features, such as width, height, and colour. There are tonnes of articles on the interwebs focussing on media queries some use ems other pixels. Check out these resources:

 Week 12 – Floats and Sprinkles
-------------------------------------
This week we looked at a wide range of different CSS rules including:

- [Positioning](earnlayout.com/position.html)
- [Floating](https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats)
- Adding [background](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp) images
- We touched on [kerning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/letter-spacing) using `<span>`and letter-spacing but as ever there are different approaches to achieve similar effects.
- CSS [dropshadows](http://www.css3generator.in/text-shadow.html)
- [Box shadows](http://www.css3generator.in/default.html#box-shadow-generator)

####A little extra…
If you want to add a simple gallery to your Hello World Page the [ResponsiveSlides.js](http://responsiveslides.com) will be the easiest way to do this. Feel free to try others if you’re feeling more adventurous.

…and this just scratches the surface. There are lots (lots!) more and as ever there are tonnes of resources to introduce you to what can be achieved with a little CSS.
