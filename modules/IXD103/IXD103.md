IXD103 – Exploring Identity
===========================

This module focuses on the design of a considered and cohesive personal identity. The module’s subject matter, is to focus it… on you, with the intention that you all have a well-designed (and well-branded) portfolio site up and running by the end of Year 1.

My goal, if you work hard enough, is to ensure you’re the next generation of celebrated designers shaping the web. (No pressure.) To do this we’ll need to consider your personal brands, ensuring you present yourselves to the world in a carefully considered manner.

We’ll look at all aspects of a personal brand: tone of voice; typographic and visual identities; developing a set of brand guidelines; and finally considering how these come together in a personal portfolio web site, your home on the web.

### Week 01 - Module Introduction; Overview; Who are you?

__29 January, 2018__

I don’t know you, and in our first week I’ll rectify that. We’ll explore who you are, starting to develop content you can use online (for example, bios you can use at Twitter, Instagram and other sites). My key questions are:

+ Who are you?
+ Who do you want to be?

We’ll use the answers to these questions in a Twitter Bios exercise so that, during Week 01, you can begin to consider your personal brand and put it into words.

It helps to look at others’ work to shape your own. Gathering inspiration will shape you as a designer, giving a clearer sense of direction. As Austin Kleon puts it [Steal Like an Artist](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0761169253/monographic-21):

> You don’t want to look like your heroes, you want to see like your heroes.

This process is similar to the concept of ‘negative space’: defining something, by defining everything around it. By looking at how other designers define themselves, a picture emerges – in the positive and negative space – that defines you.

This should run in two passes.

The first is the macro view, identifying ‘heroes’ - Who inspires you? - that will very quickly give you a sense of where you see yourself fitting in the landscape. By looking at the picture from a bird’s eye perspective it helps you define a ‘flavour’.

The second is a micro view, a much more detailed analysis of your different heroes. How are their sites structured? How is their content organised? How often is their content posted? These questions help you shape a much more detailed strategy.

To get the ball rolling, this week I’d like you to set up a Tumblr and start gathering **and reflecting upon** your discoveries. Tell us why what you’re sharing inspires you. A few lines will do. Please tag all posts that apply to this module IXD103 so I can tease out the relevant content when I do the assessment.

#### Tasks this Week

+ Follow some design-focused Tumblrs. (Monogram, Greatness.)
+ Explore Monograms (Hint Instagram)
+ Pick three interaction designers and talk about them on your tumblr blog. (How are their sites structured? How is content organised? How often is content posted?)
+ Identify three businesses (products, or services) that inspire you. (Choose your top three.• What about them is different? Why do they stand out?)
+ That’s it...

### Week 02 - The Shape of Letters; Focus on Form; Monogram I

__05 February, 2018__


This week we’re looking at monograms, exploring how we can create bold and dynamic brands by combining letterforms. We’ll explore the history of monograms, setting them in a historical context, before exploring some contemporary examples.

At this point we’re focused on form, no colour. We’re considering letterforms - positive and negative space - and just working in black and white.

Your task this week is to create a personal monogram - combining two or more of your initials - as the first part of your personal identity journey. Before you do this, please create a moodboard- analogue or digital - to gather some inspiration. Please post your development work - research, screenshots, scans and photographs - to your Tumblrs.

Remember, the Tumblr is allocated 40% of the total marks, put in the requisite work here.

#### Tasks this week

+ Focus on paper only with black and white
+ Want to see lots of ideas!

### Week 03 - A Touch of Colour; Monogram II

__12 February, 2018__


This week we’ll develop our monograms by exploring how colour might be used as a part of the design process. We’ll explore colour systems - and colour in culture - and we’ll consider how developing a colour palette for your brand can define it.

We’ll take our first look at brand guidelines, exploring the guidelines for: Jamie Oliver; FIVEUSA; HM Government; and Ulster University. Finally, looking at Pentagram’s work for MIT, we’ll explore how some brands eschew colour, opting instead to avoid it and embrace the possibilities that black and white offers.

We’ll also run a series of small group critiques to give you a chance to get some formative feedback and to see how your peers are progressing.

### Week 04 - Wordmarks; What’s in a word?

__19 February, 2018__


This week we kick off with a critique of your monograms, affording you an opportunity to receive some formative feedback. This allows you to take on board the feedback and advice offered and continue to refine the work you’re doing before the final hand-in.

With our monograms defined, we explore wordmarks and their role as part of a considered identity campaign. We explore wordmarks throughout history, highlighting some examples of best practice. For inspiration we explore different categories of wordmarks, including calligraphic, script, typographic and geometric.

Finally, we explore the importance of kerning letterforms and paying attention to the all-important details.

### Week 05 - Making Your Marque: Visual Design and Analogue Heaven

__26 February, 2018__

This week we undertook a full day sketchnoting workshop. This was designed to improve your drawing skills enabling you to communicate effectively using pen and paper.

We kicked off with some speed drawing exercises then sketchnoted a TED talk by Sir Ken Robinson. Finally we focused on building 25 ideas for brands in five minutes, an exercise in brainstorming and creativity. The outcomes for this were intended to trigger ideas for your visual brands.
