AAD116 - Introduction to Communication Design
====================


Week 01 - Introduction
----------------------

Introduction to the module and a reverse view of what will be covered over the next eleven weeks.

###Friday Lecture

OK, here we go…

Today’s lecture covered a broad look at the module and what we are looking from you. 

The value of a solid knowledge and understanding of the history of design cannot be understated. As Confucius wisely said **“Study the past if you would define the future.”** Otherwise if you know what came before you will be equipped to design for whatever is to come. No one can work effectively in a creative vacuum.

If [Dieter Rams](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/dieter-rams) hadn’t come across the [Ulm School of Design](http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english) he may never have developed his iconic design for the [Braun Radio](http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/designing-for-dieter-rams) and if [Jonathan Ive](https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html) wasn’t aware of Rams he wouldn’t have designed the first iMac, iPod and the current range of Apple products we all know and love (or hate).


We looked at [Guillermo del Toro](http://www.fastcocreate.com/3020262/master-class/guillermo-del-toro-shares-14-horror-insights-from-his-spectacular-sketch-book) and saw how a knowledge and appreciation of past artists has helped him develop the fascinating creatures in the movies such as [Pan’s Labrynth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430) and [Pacific Rim](http://www.pacificrimmovie.com).

So, for **IMD**, as well as keeping a weekly design journal* we would like you to kick off this week with a review of data design genius [Brendan Dawes](http://brendandawes.com). We want you to give us a few paragraphs on what he does and your thoughts on his work, you will need to illustrate this with appropriate images. This will live on your webspace on the IMD website and should be kept under a DES106 link. Don’t worry if you can’t build anythng yet, Peter and Gaye will cover the necessary code for this in due course. In the meantime keep your work in a Word (or similar) file, you can upload it to your webspace later.

Don’t forget to check out [Break Conference](http://breakconf.org) and grab yourself a ticket while they’re still available.

*IxD should also keep a weekly journal of their thoughts and progress on this and the other modules. It will help you rationalise what is covered and will provide a vehicle in which you can refer back to when you need to research material for future projects.

The other project for IxD and IMD is the Type Tile project. Over the coming weeks you will choose a period of history and pick out a typeface that particularly appealed to you. You will make up a 3 x 3 grid of these, as the per image below, and present it as part of your final submission.

![Type tile example](http://pixelpaper.org/ixd/type-tile.jpg)

###IMD Project 01 – Brendan Dawes

The first project on DES106 is to do a little research on interaction designer Brendan Dawes. Write a few paragraphs on what you discover about Dawes and illustrate your piece with suitable images.

###Friday IxD Seminar

To kick things off we introduced two essential tools any self respecting interaction designer should be familiar with. 

This week we need you to download yourself a copy of [Atom](https://atom.io) and using the text in the attachment below render what you see in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics). You should mark the headings, paragraphs, lists, etc as you see fit. If you can, print off a copy of what you have created or save it for future reference.

Download the attached [Markdown zip file](http://pixelpaper.org/ixd/week01_markdown.zip) and, using the PDF as a guide reset the markdown_raw.rtf file in Markdown. You won’t be able to match the PDF exactly (this will come later with the aid of the magic of CSS) but set it as you see fit using Markdown in Atom.




Week 02 – Cave Painting and Illuminated Manuscripts
---------------------------------------------------

Starting with cave paintings we move forward to the first written language and end with illuminated manuscripts.

We covered a LOT today with any one aspect worthy of a lecture in itself. But we have a lot more to cover in the coming weeks and rather than go into too much detail on the early history today give us a taste for a number of different areas.


From man’s earliest markings at [Cantabria](http://cuevas.culturadecantabria.com/english/default.htm) the human race has been leaving its mark on the world in many different visual forms. They have been the source of inspiration for designers and artists such as [Picasso][2], writers and movie directors such as [Ridley Scott][3].

[Early writing][4] forms cover millennia of mans history, with many different forms developing throughout the world. Thankfully, as designers, we usually only need to work with one language in our day-to-day routine, but on occasions we will need our work translated onto others. 

The [Golden Ratio][6] is abundant in nature and has been used by architects, artists and designers in the creation of their work for centuries. While not the only way to approach the design of your own work it is certainly a solid, tried-and-tested place to start.

[Tim Brown][7] has created a very useful online [Modular Scale][8] which will help you – once you get to grips with CSS – to develop a well controlled balance to the typography on your Design Journal. Jeremy Church’s [Type Scale](http://type-scale.com) adds a very easy visual dimension to it. What’s more you can grab the CSS from here and add it to your own site.

Make sure to read Christopher Murphy's [Contrast Through Scale][1] on Typecast's blog and add your thoughts in your Design Journal. 

Handwritten books, for many, many years, were the only way society could share and gather knowledge. The privilege of the powerful, religious bodies and the very rich, books were extremely expensive to reproduce restricting the spread of knowledge to those who could afford it.

Books were painstakingly created by [scribes][9], taking many months to complete one book, you can appreciate they were not cheap!

But by the mid 15th Century that was about to dramatically change and the days of the [Illuminated Scripts][10] were numbered…

###IMD Group Logo Design

Following today’s brief overview of branding the following resources will help you develop your logo for your group projects.

[Logo Design Love](http://www.logodesignlove.com/logo-design-tips) – is a very useful website with this section particularly appropriate for your current project.

[Pentagram](http://www.pentagram.com/work/#/all/all/newest) are one of the world's leading brand development consultancies. Take a look at their 'Branding & Identities' and 'Marks' section under the 'All Work' tab.

Books worth checking out (and these should be in the library in Belfast) include:

[Designing Brand Identity](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Designing-Brand-Identity-Essential-Branding/dp/1118099206/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1381917117&sr=1-1&keywords=brand+design)

[Marks of Excellence](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Marks-Excellence-History-Taxonomy-Trademarks/dp/0714864749/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1381917585&sr=1-1&keywords=marks+of+excellence)

###IMD Project 02 – Ancient Language

Research an ancient language and write your findings on its origins and influences. Illustrate your written material with suitable images, you can if you wish, create your own illustrations and include these.

Add this material to the end of Week 02 in your design journal. You should aim to write around 300 words.

###Friday IxD Seminar

Great to see everyone (almost) up and running on GitHub. Don't worry if you are still having problems getting your page up, we will get that sorted out next week. Tim's excellent [Hello World][11] tutorial will take you through the process and allow you to start personalising the content. We will look at changing the background next week so don’t worry of you can’t do that now.

Your first project for this module will be to get this page up and ruinning and write profile about you. Nothing huge just a few carefully crafted paragraphs introducing you and your work to the world and including links to relevent external sites (Twitter, Instagram, Flickr, etc). 

**Before putting pen to paper make sure you research how other designers approach their own self promotion.** Designers worth checking out are:
- [Andy Budd](http://www.andybudd.com/about.htm)
- [Craig Mod](http://craigmod.com/about)
- [Sarah Parmenter](http://www.sazzy.co.uk/about)
- [Jessica Hische](http://jessicahische.is/anoversharer)
- [Dan Cederholm](http://simplebits.com/about)

Make sure you research others, don't let the list above be your only source of material.

This, combined with your research and work on the Markdown file last week will equate to 20% of this modules mark. The completion date for this part of your coursework is **Friday 16th October**. Your work should be presented on your GitHub site (we will look at creating additional pages over the next week or two so don’t worry about where everything will go.

Week 03 – Guttenberg and Moveable Type
--------------------------------------

**The invention of the printing press revolutionises the dissemination of information and starts a typographic revolution in the process.**

This weeks lecture looked at the impact of the printing press and its influence on the spread of knowledge in the western world. We also picked out some of the pioneers of type design, looking at how improvements in the printing process helped shape the design of type. 

We also looked broadly at branding with a view to working towards the creation of your company brand design for the group project.



###Typography Today

A solid understanding of and appreciation for type is essential to your development as designers. We will touch on typography frequently this semester and through all of the design modules so learn as much as you can about type. You have been warned!

The following links to online resources and books will get you kicked off.

####Web Typography

Check out Tim Brown's [Nice Web Type][1]

[Typekit][2] is a great way to get started with proper web fonts with lots of choices of good quality type. Unless you are familiar with CSS at this moment wait until that has been covered in your other module. You will be able to use two fonts free of charge on the trial account.

A showcase for Google fonts can be found on [hellohappy.org][4]

The home grown [Typecast][5] is worth taking a look at. 

A List Apart's piece on [Typography & Web Fonts][6] is worth reading. In fact you should keep a regular eye on [A List Apart][7] for articles on all things web related.

[The League of Moveable Type's blog][3] is worth checking out

IMD Project 03 – Typographic History
------------------------------------

**For this weeks project** we want you to choose one typeface from the following list and research the designer, the typeface in question and any other typefaces they may have designed. 

You should illustrate your piece with suitable images both from the original typeface and any contemporary uses you can find.

Although designed, on some occasions, many hundreds of years ago, these typefaces are still in use today and are some of the most popular fonts around. 

- Jenson
- Bembo
- Garamond
- Caslon
- Baskerville
- Bodoni
- Akzindenz-Grotesk


###IxD Project 02 – Group Presentation

Your second project for this module is a group presentation looking at one of the topics listed below and delivered in front of the rest of the class. This project is worth 30% of the modules mark and will carry a high team-based mark so make sure you all participate fully. Peer review will be used to determine how each team member performed.

- Group 01 – Bauhaus and the New Typography
- Group 02 – Design Systems for the Olympic Games
- Group 03 – Pioneers of Digital Design
- Group 04 – Pioneers of Postmodern Graphic Design

Research the topic fully, books, journals and the internet, to make sure your presentation is accurate.

You can use Keynote or Powerpoint to make your presentation and each member of the team should talk during the day.

Presentations will be delivered on Friday 31st October in 82D09 from 12.30 onwards. You will be marked on the day of the presentation and feedback will be offered to each team.

Week 04 – A Century of Change
-----------------------------

As we saw the Industrial Revolution was a period of massive change, particularly the second revolution around 1840–1870. 

Society moved from an rural base to an urban one with a focus on mass production. People looking for work moved from the country into towns and cities where they found themselves involved in textile manufacturing, metal production, machine tool production. 

The time around 1900 was a massive period for change, with the introduction of numerous new technologies from the electric light bulb, radio transmissions, the motor vehicle, flight, photography, moving pictures… 

The growing demand for more materials, more steel for manufacturing, more machinery, more roads, more canals, more of railways, left little room for craft and quality. Soon artists and designers reacted against this industrialisation.

####Japonism

The opening of trading routes with Japan around the 1850s saw an influx of Japanese art and craft into Europe, particularly Paris, the epicentre for the arts at this time. This Japanese influence of Europe art became known as [Japonisme][1].

The bold colours, flattened perspectives and graphic quality of Japanese woodblock prints had a particularly profound effect on many artists towards the end of the 1800s. 

Artists such as Edouard Manet, Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Vincent Van Gogh, Paul Cezanne and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec revolutionised the art world. They cast aside the traditions of Realism to portray the world as they saw it through Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. 

Artists crossed many disciplines from painting to sculpture, architecture and design. [Toulouse-Lautrec][2] was a painter, illustrator and printmaker but is probably better know for his striking posters of Paris life particularly the Moulin Rouge.

###Arts & Crafts Movement

The Arts & Crafts Movement was essentially an anti Industrial Revolution movement. The Arts & Crafts aesthetic started as a reaction against the staid, production-line style developed by machine production. It drew its inspiration from nature keeping things simple without superfluous decoration.

**[William Morris][3]** was undoubtedly the leading figure of the Arts & Crafts. Best known for his distinctive textile designs Morris was also an artist, illustrator, author, typographer, printer, bookbinder and medievalist. He helped establish the modern fantasy genre influencing authors such as JRR Tolkien.

He also founded the Kelmscott Press publishing high quality books and influencing the revival of the private press, bringing the quality back to printing that the industrial age was losing.

###Art Nouveau

Taking its inspiration from natural forms and nature and imported Japanese arts and crafts the [Art Nouveau][4]  style could be seen in architecture, ceramics, jewellery design, paintings and the newly emerging graphic design.

Artists associated with the movement included, amongst others, [Aubrey Beardsley][5] and [Alphonse Mucha][6]

###The Glasgow School

[The Glasgow School][7] grew from a group of influential artists and designers who began to gather in Glasgow. The most prominent members of the Glasgow School were known as The Four:

[Margaret MacDonald][8] – Painter and glass artist

[Charles Rennie Mackintosh][9] – Architect, designer, water colourist and artist and by far the most successful of The Four. He married Margaret MacDonald

[Frances MacDonald][10] – Artist, designer, illustrator

[Herbert MacNair][11] – Artist, designer and teacher. He married Frances MacDonald

###Vienna Secession

Also known as the Union of Austrian Artists, the Vienna Secession formed in 1897 by a group of Austrian painters, sculptors and architects. One of the most prominent members of the group was [Gustav Klimt][13] who is best known for his richly decorated paintings and murals.

[Peter Behrens](http://designhistoryresearch.wordpress.com/category/peter-behrens) is widely seen as the first true graphic designer.

###IMD Project 04 – The Design Revolution


As with your previous two projects choosing one area from the list below and research the movement discussing the main artist/designers but focussing on one of the main figures. 

You should aim to write around 300–500 words with plenty of visual material presented to back up your findings.

- Japonism
- Art Nouveau
- Arts & Crafts
- The Glasgow School
- Vienna Secession
- Munich Secession



Week 05 – Dada and Propaganda in Design
------------------------------------

After the introduction of Japanese art and craft to Europe we witnessed a revolution in art and design in Europe and beyond. From Impressionism to Art Nouveau the speed of change accelerated and there was no turning back.

Where the Arts & Crafts movement fought the industrialisation of the world other movements embraced it…

####Plakatstil

In 1906, when the Priester Match Company held a competition to design a promotional poster they had to have been expecting a range of submissions in the richly decorative Art Nouveau style of the time. 

No one could have expected one strikingly simple entry which showed nothing but two matchsticks lying below the bold Priester namestyle. Designed by 23 year old designer [Lucian Bernhard][1] this minimalist approach to design became known as Plakatstil or Poster Style and Sachplakat (Object Poster).

Bernhard's simplified approach would influence design for years to follow and would be seen in everything from corporate identity to icon design.

The climate of antisemitism in Germany prompted Bernhard to emigrate to New York in 1923 where he opened a studio and worked as a graphic artist and interior designer . Bernhard also designed a large range of fonts during his career which included the still very popular [Bernhard Modern][2].

[2]:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Modern

####Propaganda and WWI

In Britain, the outbreak of World War One prompted the development of the Ministry of Information whose task was to mobilise public opinion against Germany and help with the war effort.

Recruitment posters were central to the war effort with the most common theme that of appeals for everyone to do their fair share. One of the most famous from this time has to have been the Lord Kitchener, 'Your Country Needs You' poster.

German military officials suggested that British propaganda was key to their defeat with Adolf Hitler later employing British propaganda techniques in his WWII campaign.

####Futurism

One of the most dynamic movements of this period Futurism, unlike Arts & Crafts, embraced the future celebrating the industrial age, speed, machinery and violence.

Established by writer and theorist [Filippo Marinetti][3] the movement grew to embrace painting, sculpture, architecture, poetry and photography. Futurist pieces reflected the energy of the industrial age and the horrors of war, paintings such as Umberto Boccioni's '[The City Rises][4]' show man's struggle with his surroundings while poems such as those in Marinetti's '[Words in Freedom][5] reflect the same energies through groundbreaking use of typography.

[5]:http://cdm.reed.edu/cdm4/artbooks/marinetti.php

####Dada

The Dadaist movement grew from a reaction against the horrors of World War I. Dada began in Zurich by artists and poets associated with the [Cabaret Voltaire][10], the movement rejected logic and reason, in many way it was an anti-art movement questioning everything that came before it. [Marcel Duchamp's][6] [readymades][11] were the epitome of the movement. 

Other key members of the movement included, [Hannah Hoch][7], [Raoul Hausmann][8] and [Kurt Schwitters][9]…

####Art Deco

A heavily influential style, [Art Deco][1] originated in France after World War I and spread internationally on the 1930s and 40s. Art Deco combined traditional craft themes with industrial age imagery and materials. The style was characterised by bold colours, strong geometric shapes and rich ornamentation.

Where Art Nouveau, rejected technology Art Deco embraced and celebrated industrialisation and the changes it brought. The movement could be sen in the visual arts, graphic design, ceramics, jewellery, architecture, furniture and product design.  

In graphic design, one of the best know figures was the Ukrainian-French painter, poster artist, typeface designer [A.M. Cassandre][2].

His work for the Dubonnet wine company were among the first designed to be viewed from a moving vehicle. The message has to be big, bold and instantly recognisable.

####IMD Project 05 – Plakatstil Poster

Taking what you have seen on the Plakatstil movement we want you to create a poster that promotes Break Conference in November.
Work to A4 dimensions but just produce something for the screen. You can use whatever medium you want, pencils, paint, Photoshop, Sketch.

You should start by thoroughly researching the Plakatstil movement and the key artists involved before creating anything. This will give you a solid foundation on which to develop your ideas. 

Make sure you place all of your initial ideas, your development work and the final design on you Design Journal.
The deadline for completion is Wednesday 5th November 2014 with the winning poster announced on Friday 7th 2014.

**IMPORTANT** Everyone must complete this project but only those who turned up to today’s lecture, (an extremely disappointing 17) are eligible candidates for the Break Conference ticket. 


Week 06 – Revolution and the Bauhaus
------------------------------------

The Russian Revolution and The Bauhaus generate visual vocabularies which still influence design today.

####De Stijl

As we saw De Stijl (The Style) was developed as a reaction to the First World War. Founders [Theo van Doesburg][1] and [Piet Mondrian][2] were looking for a cure to the individualism and nationalist egotism they saw as the cause of the war. 

Their minimal, geometric abstract style could not be identified by any single country or individual and as such they saw this as the most suitable style for the post-war era.

**Piet Mondrian**

Prior to founding De Stijl, Dutch painter, Mondrian was heavily influenced by the Cubist work of Pablo Picasso and George Braque. The outbreak of WWI saw Mondrian remain in his home country of the Netherlands. When war ended in 1918 he returned to France where he began to produce the grid-based paintings he became famous for.

**Theo van Doesburg**

Artist, author, poet and architect Van Doesburg was influenced by the early works of Vincent van Gogh but this suddenly changed when he read [Wassily Kandinsky's][3] biography. In Composition (The Cow) van Doesburg explored his reductive technique by distilling his studies of the cow down to simple geometric forms. The process acted as a means to educate his audience on his new approach to art and design.

Van Doesburg extended this process to type design with his geometric san-serif typeface. Designed in 1919, this incredibly modern typeface was based on a 25 square grid and almost 100 years later, on the right project, still wouldn't look out of place. The Foundry's [Architype Van Doesburg][4] revived the typeface for the digital age.

Van Doesburg travelled across Europe promoting the De Stijl movement and in 1922 became briefly involved with Dadaism working with Kurt Schwitters on the [Dada Campaign][5] During this time he also worked with the Constructivists and became interested in the Bauhaus.

####Constructivism

Originating in Russia in 1919, the Constructivist movement placed art as a practice for social good. The movement had a far-reaching influence on 20th century modern art and design movements.

**El Lissitzky**

The Russian painter, typographer, architect and designer El Lissitzky illustrated Jewish books for children before developing his abstract images called [Prouns][6] which were ‘the interchange station between painting and architecture.’

He experimented widely with photomontage, printmaking, graphic design and print making becoming one of the central figures of the Constructivist movement.

**Alexander Rodchenko**

Artist, sculptor, photographer and graphic designer, [Alexander Rodchenko][7], along with Lissitzky was one of the most prolific post-revolution Constructivist artists of this period. His striking designs for book covers, movie posters and advertisements combined strong geometric layouts, bold san-serif typography and photomontage to great effect. 

The Constructivist movement has been copied by many designers since its rise with designers today still influenced heavily by this very distinctive style. 

Patrick Burgoyne’s 2008 [Creative Review][8] piece looks at its impact.

####The Bauhaus

Having suffered the catastrophic defeat of WWI Germany was in a state of economic, political and cultural ruin. The need to rebuild all aspects of live was never more important. With new new director [Walter Gropius][9] at the helm, the Bauhaus school opened its doors in Germany in 1919 publishing its manifesto in local newspapers:

#####Bauhaus Manifesto
“The ultimate goal of all art is the building! The ornamentation of the building was once the main purpose of the visual arts, and they were considered indispensable parts of the great building. Today, they exist in complacent isolation, from which they can only be salvaged by the purposeful and cooperative endeavours of all artisans. Architects, painters and sculptors must learn a new way of seeing and understanding the composite character of the building, both as a totality and in terms of its parts. Their work will then re-imbue itself with the spirit of architecture, which it lost in salon art.

The art schools of old were incapable of producing this unity – and how could they, for art may not be taught. They must return to the workshop. This world of mere drawing and painting of draughtsmen and applied artists must at long last become a world that builds. When a young person who senses within himself a love for creative endeavour begins his career, as in the past, by learning a trade, the unproductive “artist” will no longer be condemned to the imperfect practice of art because his skill is now preserved in craftsmanship, where he may achieve excellence.

Architects, sculptors, painters – we all must return to craftsmanship! For there is no such thing as “art by profession”. There is no essential difference between the artist and the artisan. The artist is an exalted artisan. Merciful heaven, in rare moments of illumination beyond man’s will, may allow art to blossom from the work of his hand, but the foundations of proficiency are indispensable to every artist. This is the original source of creative design.

So let us therefore create a new guild of craftsmen, free of the divisive class pretensions that endeavoured to raise a prideful barrier between craftsmen and artists! Let us strive for, conceive and create the new building of the future that will unite every discipline, architecture and sculpture and painting, and which will one day rise heavenwards from the million hands of craftsmen as a clear symbol of a new belief to come."

#####The way forward

The Bauhaus years in Weimar (1919-1924) sought to unify art and craftsmanship in order to build a new future. Stained glass, wood and metal workshops were taught by craftsmen. 

Colour theory was covered by leading artists of the time – [Paul Klee][10], [Wassily Kandinsky][11] and later [Josef Albers][14]. While [Johannes Itten’s][12] preliminary course taught the fundamental principles of design and developed their understanding of the nature of materials. 

German painter, sculptor, designer and choreographer [Oskar Schlemmer][15] ran the theatre workshop. Schlemmer’s work would inspire numerous theatre and dance groups such as Philippe Decouflé’s video for New Order’s [True Faith][15]. 

The schools exhibition of 1923 was attended by over 15,000 people and was internationally acclaimed. Itten was replaced the same year by [Laszlo Moholy-Nagy][13] as head of the preliminary course.

####Laszlo Moholy-Nagy

As new head of the preliminary school Moholy-Nagy explored painting, photography, film, sculpture and graphic design. His love for photography and  typography developed an interest in the Bauhaus for visual communications. 

His photographic experiments replaced normal viewpoints with extreme close-ups, bird’s eye and worm’s eye views and angled viewpoints. He antagonised the Bauhaus artists claiming photography would eventually replace painting.

Tensions between the government and the Bauhaus eventually saw the school close in 1933 after the Gestapo demanded the removal of “cultural Bolsheviks” replacing staff with Nazi sympathisers.

Week 07 – WWII, HfG Ulm and Modernism in the US
-----------------------------------------------

World War II forces many of Europes most influential designers to flee to the safety of the US while the Ulm School of Design picks up the pieces in Germany.

This week took a look at Modernism in design and started with a few points looking at how the Modernist movement was defined.

- Reject traditional forms and decorative elements
- Seek a solution that is simple and direct
- Use systematic methods rather than intuitive ones
- Think about relationships in form and content
- Use geometric shapes: circle, triangle, square
- Use primary colours
- Use sans serif typefaces
- Show contrast in typographical material
- Use photographs and photomontage rather than drawings or illustrations
- Use silhouetted photographs with white backgrounds
- Use maps and diagrams
- Use graphic symbols and icons
- Use of asymmetric page layout
- Use of grid or clearly delineated page-organising method
- Apply a planned visual hierarchy

A brief look at [degenerate art](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24819441) showed how Adolf Hitler persecuted modern artists, designers, musicians, basicially anyone who didn't conform to his ideals.

Nazi persecution forced numerous artists, architects and designers to flee Europe for the safety of distant shores. Many mover to the US where the creative community welcomed them with open arms. The move saw a cultural shift of creativity and intellect from Europe to the States. However, all was not lost at home.

The [Ulm School of Design](http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english/) sought to redress the balance in Europe. The origins of Ulm School of Design goes back to the Scholl Foundation. The Scholl Foundation was created in 1950 by [Inge Scholl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inge_Scholl) in memory of their siblings Sophie and Hans Scholl, mmembers of the resistance group "White Rose" who were executed by the Nazis in 1943.

Inge, along with [Otl Aicher](http://www.1972municholympics.co.uk/otl_aicher.php) and [Max Bill](http://www.max-bill.com) founded the Ulm School of Design in 1953 where it quickly gained a reputation ans one of the finest design schools in the world, sceond only to the Bauhaus.

Also referred to as the International Typographic Style or the International Style, [The Swiss Style](hhttp://swissgraphicdesign.blogspot.co.uk) originated in Switzerland in the 1950s and remained a major movement in design for over 20 years. Still influencing designers today the movement was refined at two design schools design. In Basel it was led by [Armin Hofmann](http://www.aiga.org/medalist-arminhofmann) and [Emil Ruder](http://www.designishistory.com/1940/emil-ruder/) while [Josef Müller-Brockman](http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/reputations-josef-muller-brockmann) headed the movement in Zurich. [Lessons from Swiss Style](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/07/17/lessons-from-swiss-style-graphic-design) from Smashing Magazine is worth checking out for a broad overview of the movement.

The shift of creative talent to the US had a profound effect on the resident design community. Previously, Modernism had been rejected when the 1913 Armoury Show introduced the movement to America. Designers eager to learn from Modernism had to satisfy their thirst through exhibition catalogues and brochures from their European counterparts.

The movement didn’t making a lasting impact until the 1930s when artists, architects and designers started to flee Europe for the safety of the US.

Key designers of the American Modernist movement included Alexey Brodovitch, Herbert Bayer, Herbert Matter, Paul Rand, Saul Bass and Milton Glaser to name a handful.

Week 08 – Break
---------------

Students are encouraged to attend [Break](http://breakconf.org) this week.

If you are not attending you should spend this time catching up on your Design Journals. The will be no lecture on week 08.

Week 09 – Postmodernism 
--------------------------------------------------

[Wim Crouwel](http://designmuseum.org/design/wim-crouwel) is a Dutch graphic designer best known for his work with the Stedelijk Museum. His book, [New Alphabet](http://www.designers-books.com/new-alphabet-wim-crouwel-1967), outlines some of his work on type design. Check out his [free app ](http://www.uniteditions.com/shop/wim-crouwel-digital-catalogue).

Seen as the father of [Wolfgang Weingart](http://www.aiga.org/medalist-wolfgang-weingart) studied under Emil Ruder and Armin Hofmann at the Basel School of Design. He soon tired of the restrictive Swiss typographic style and began experimenting with, pushing the boundaries of what type could do. He was fascinated by the effects of letterspacing and frequently stretched words until they became almost unintelligible. His book [My Way To Typography](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/3037784261?ie=UTF8&keywords=my%20way%20to%20typography&qid=1416577223&ref_=sr_1_1&sr=8-1) is now a must read for anyone interested in design.

Two students of Weingarts, [April Greiman](http://aprilgreiman.com) and [Dan Friedman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Friedman_%28graphic_designer%29) carried on the postmodern tradition in the US

Colin Fulcher, better known as [Barney Bubbles](http://www.barneybubbles.com/blog) frequently appropriated artistic styles to suit the requirements for the job.

[Paula Scher](http://www.paulascher.com)

Best known for his work fot the Sex Pistols [Jamie Reid](http://www.jamiereid.org) developed an anti-design approach to his work for the anarchic punk group.

[Vaughan Oliver](http://www.hardformat.org/designers/vaughan-oliver-designer)

What can I say about [Russell Mills](http://www.russellmills.com/rebuild/index.html) other than man’s a legend.

[Neville Brody](http://www.rca.ac.uk/more/staff/professor-neville-brody) you should also check out his work on his company website [Research Studios](http://www.researchstudios.com)

David Carson - [The David Carson video](http://vimeo.com/channels/artistseries/18770585) is from a series of artist and designer movies from Hillman Curtis. I would thoroughly recommend you check out some of the others in this series.

[Stefan Sagmeister](http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com)  is a designer you should definitely keep an eye on. His playful, inventive style covers numerous projects both online and offline.

Week 10 – The Rise of the Machines
----------------------------------------------------

The launch of the [Apple Macintosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtvjbmoDx-I) in 1984 saw the true beginning of the computer revolution, especially where designers were concerned.

After spending 30 years working as a commercial artist [Ed Fella](http://www.edfella.com) entered the MFA program at Cranbrook Academy of Art at the age of 47. This subsequently saw Fella become recognised as a pioneer of postmodern graphic design.

Meanwhile the Apple Mac was beginning to make an impact on the design industry. The key to the computers success, apart form dedicated design-based software was the intutive interface. Apple's graphical user interface made it very easy for those not familiar with computers to interact with the system and its software.

Parallel to the 1984 launch of the Apple Mac, design duo [Zuzana Licko](http://www.emigre.com/Bios.php?d=10) and [Rudy VanderLans](http://www.emigre.com/Bios.php?d=2) launched [Emigre](http://www.emigre.com/index.php) to challenge the limitations the new computer possessed.

As the system became more sophisticated software developments followed suit. Working with the new-found freedom [Neville Brody](http://www.rca.ac.uk/more/staff/professor-neville-brody/) and [Jon Wozencroft](http://www.rca.ac.uk/more/staff/jon-wozencroft/) created [Fuse](http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/design/all/06768/facts.fuse_120.htm), a quarterly publication the explored the new world of digital type design.

Designers quickly embraced and exploited the new creative possibilities. Company's such as [The Designers Rebpublic](http://www.thedesignersrepublic.com/), [Me Company](http://mecompany.com/), and [Why Not Associates](http://www.whynotassociates.com) made the new medium their own and pushed its capabilities with numerous exciting and innovative projects.

In 1989 [Tim Berners-Lee](http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee) set the wheels in motion on a new medium that would change the way we communicate forever. 

Starting life as a fluid medium designers quickly imposed restrictions on the web to make their designs do what they had been familiar with on the printed page. [Hillman Curtis](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/21/technology/hillman-curtis-a-pioneer-in-web-design-dies-at-51.html?_r=0) was an early pioneer creating websites for Yahoo, Adobe, Paramount and Fox Searchlight Pictures among others.

Tables, then Adobe Flash was used to create complex web designs which often needed to be view on specific browsers or at particular resolutions. Sites became overladen with images, video and surperfluous code slowing delivery of content down.

Things had to change.



Week 11 – The Here and Now
--------------------------

As mentioned, the final [Refresh Belfast](http://refreshbelfast.com) of the year will be held in the [Black Box](http://www.blackboxbelfast.com/about-2/#gethere) on 15th December. Try your best to come along.

We kicked today's talk with a look at [Stefan Sagmeister](http://www.sagmeisterwalsh.com) and his Ted talk [The Power of Time Off](http://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_sagmeister_the_power_of_time_off). Sagmeister is a incredibly creative and innovative designer and one you should definitely keep an eye on.

The main focus on today's lecture however was on how we deal with designing for today's proliferation of devices. We consume digital content across numerous devices. We may start reading a piece on our laptop and continue it on an iPad before printing off a hard copy for our great aunt. We saw that by sticking to tried and tested principles we will be able to design for anything technology throws at us.

####Proportions
Considering the relationships between elements lies at the heart of designing for the fluid web. Inspiration can be drawn from architecture. [Sir Christopher Wren](http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/wren_christopher.shtml), one of the most highly acclaimed English architects in history used harmonic ratios like the [Golden Section](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) and the [Rule of Thirds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds) in the creation of his masterpieces.

####Hierarchy
We can apply this at the markup layer, as we’ve said many times before, HTML is a design element. [Wim Crouwel](https://designmuseum.org/designers/wim-crouwel) is renowned for his information driven approach to design and his groundbreaking typeface New Alphabet, one of the earliest truly digital fonts. The organisation of elements on a screen needs to be considered, the relationship of elementsto each other, such as those displayed by Crouwell, can lie at the heart of a systematic approach to design.

####Typography

Given the opportunities we now have to use rich web typography, an understanding of how type works and its ratios and proportions can underpin fluid web experiences. Long gone are the days of sticking to Arial, Verdana Georgia and Times New Roman. Nowadays we have a wealth of typefaces to choose from and a CSS3 has opened the doors to much more control.

Services such as [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts) and [Typekit](https://typekit.com) offer a much richer range of fonts to work with than the current 'web safe' choices we were restricted to in the past.

####Composition
An understanding of composition and how elements relate to each other in design can be applied beyond the fixed world of paper to the fluid web we now design for. 

A master and pioneer of his craft, [Josef Müller-Brockmann](http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/reputations-josef-muller-brockmann), his work emphasises the underlying grid systems and the discerning, but well chosen palettes of both colour and type which are minimal, yet still rich. Though Müller-Brockmann’s work was for the fixed world of the page, it also emphasised an understanding of ratios and relationships and this can be applied to the world of the fluid web.

####Systems
How elements relate to each other within often unpredictable situations lies at the heart of a fluid approach. Establishing systems that consider multiple outcomes can serve as the cornerstone of fluid and flexible designs.

[Erik Spiekermann](http://spiekermann.com/en/about) is a hugely talented German typophile, we can learn a great deal from his practice. Spiekermann’s approach to design is systemic. It considers elements as part of a wider system. Considering elements at every scale, from a business card to the signage in a building.

####Narrative
At the heart of what we do is storytelling. We can learn about storytelling and pacing by looking outwards, to the world of film, for example.

As our medium becomes more dynamic we can learn from some of our greatest movie directors such as [Stanley Kubrick](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000040/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm) narrative and film. We should consider narratives, stories and transitions and how they can be used in our increasingly dynamic web environment.

Interaction Futures
-------------------

Today looked at the cutting edge of interaction design and possible future applications. 
>“The future is already here. It’s just not evenly distributed.” William Gibson, Speculative Fiction Novelist

The Designers Republic were heavily influenced by Gibson and many of his future musings have come to reality. If you are in anyway a fan of science fiction literature his book [Neuromancer](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0006480411/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0006480411&linkCode=as2&tag=activeight-21&linkId=KAPH6ZQADMREFQHU) is a must read.

Keeping abreast of the growing multitude of connected devices is an ever increasingly difficult task. We are continualy faced with a seemilgly unending barrage of devices with their own requirements so designing to accommodate every single one of these is impossible. 

Right? 

Wrong.

As we saw today (for those of you who turned up), while the way forward is in many way unpredictable, if we equip ourselves with the right skills along the way we will be able to design for whatever technology throws at us next. 

Design principles we have looked at over the last 12 weeks will provide us with the foundations of the design skills we will cary with us for the rest of our lives. 

Microsoft’s [Future Vision](http://www.microsoft.com/office/vision) video looks at a number of exciting possibilities technologies may take us. [A Day Made of Glass 2][2] from Corning looks at other future technologies. 

Some of these technologies are actually with us now, Microsoft is looking at a number of alternative uses for the [xBox Kinect][3] which are pushing the boundaries of interaction design in a number of ways.

MIT called the [LeapMotion][4] “The Most Important New Technology Since the Smart Phone. 

[Robert Hodgin][5] is pushing the boundaries of its capabilities. Make sure you check out the rest of Robert’s site, this guy is creating some amazing work.

We also looked at [Google Glass][6] and took a brief look a [smart watches][7] 

Products such as Berg’s [Little Printer][8] and [Sifteo Cubes][9]are bringing the digital world into the physical.

[Noteloop][10] has a fantastic resource of fantasy/future interface design.

###Principles that stand the test of time and technology

- **Hierarchy** – The Golden Ratio and Fibonacci sequence are still relevant today. 
Getting the balance right is vital in delivering information on smaller screens
Balance, scale, space, line and shape.
- **Typography** – The need to understand good typographic choices, what’s appropriate for a particular task has always been a standard from the Illuminated scripts to letting you know if your flight is on time.
- **Colour** – Bauhaus teaching of colour theory by Kandinsky, Klee, and Albers still very valid today.
- **Branding and Icon Design** – Otto Neurath and Gerd Arntz Isotype became the standard to icon creation.
The creation of easily read icons is more important now that it has ever been.

If we learn from the past we will be equiped with a rock solid foundation, one which will allow us to deal with what the future will bring to us with confidence.

A solid grounding in design history will allow you to understand why these principles are still important today and this knowledge will give you an unbelievably a rich canvas from which to draw inspiration.

If you can nurture your thirst to learn now and keep learning, exploring, experimenting and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible you will be able to tackle anything that is put in your path.
