## Week 01

### When We Build

**Watch –  Wilson Miner’s [When We Build](https://vimeo.com/34017777)** - and write your thoughts on what he says. Try to aim for around 300words (or more if needed).

### IxD Markdown.

Markdown is an incredibly useful way to write and read text that can be converted into valid HTML.

Everything you need to know about Markdown can be found on [John Gruber’s](https://twitter.com/gruber?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) website.

This plug-in for Brackets will allow you to see your Markdown in realtime – [MarkdownPreview](https://github.com/gruehle/MarkdownPreview).

Taking the attached [Markdown Exercise](https://github.com/ixdbelfast/ixdbelfast.github.io/blob/master/modules/IXD102/resources/week01_markdown.zip) and using the jpg as a guide use Markdown to add style to the copy. When complete, take a screen grab of the result and post it to your Tumblr.

 Deliverable 01 - Type Specimen Poster
-------------------------------------

Your first project for this module is to create a [Type Specimen Poster](https://uk.pinterest.com/jsgore/typography-type-specimen-posters/) based on **one** of the fonts.

- Jenson
- Bembo
- Garamond
- Caslon
- Baskerville
- Bodoni
- Akzindenz-Grotesk
- Futura

Your poster should be A3 (420mm x 297mm) and ideally created in Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop, alternatively you may use [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) (students can avail of a 50% discount for this excellent product). If you are not familiar with any of these yet don’t panic. You could use (and it really pains me to say this) Microsoft Word until you get to grips with the former. 

The poster should be posted to Tumblr **there is no need to print anything**. 

Research the subject to get a handle on what a type specimen poster should look like (you could even write a little blog post on the subject) before putting **pencil to paper**. Don’t just rely on the links we provide, find your own material. As with any creative project **always, always, always** start on paper **never** jump straight onto a computer, you will never create anything meaningful this way.

You poster should obviously feature your chosen font but you should also include a couple of paragraphs on the designer who created the font, give us a little background to who they are and what else they may have created. Dont worry if you don't have access to the fonts, use one that looks closest to it.

If you have any questions don’t hesitate to get in touch.

**Completion Date: Thursday 25th October 2018**

Deliverable 02 – Design History Presentation
-------------------------------------------------------

Your second project for this module is to develop a Design History Presentation based on one of the following titles.

- Bauhaus and the New Typography
- Design Systems for the Olympic Games
- The Influence of Modern Art
- The Modern Movement in America
- Pioneers of Postmodern Graphic Design
- Pioneers of Digital Design
- The pioneers of Web Design

Each group will deliver a ten minute presentation based around one of the titles. It will be essential to get together in your teams at some stage early next week to discuss who will be responsible for different aspects of the presentation. GitHub is a great way to collaborate on material and keep track of everyone’s input it will also allow us to see how each member of the team has performed. 

This – [How to Collaborate On GitHub](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-collaborate-on-github--net-34267) is a useful resource on getting up and running with as a group.

You will find most of the material you need to know from [Meggs' History of Graphic Design](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Meggs-History-Graphic-Design-Philip/dp/0470168730/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) don't worry about rushing out and buying it (it’s pretty expensive) the library will have a copy you can work from.

**Presentations will be delivered on Friday 30th November.**

### Research, research, research
As with any project research is vital at the early stages (and throughout) to ensure you are going in the right direction and what you are planning to present is relevant and accurate.

Deliverable 03 – Design Essay Webpage (50%)
-------------------------------------------
For the final we would like to you write an essay of **no less than 1,500 words** on one of the designers listed below.
<!--
Your essay should be well planned and researched before you start writing. Take a look at a few of the designers in question to see which one you wish to cover.
<!--
Your final essay should be in the form of a single page website, suitably illustrated with photographs and images of the designers work. You may want to consider designing your essay in the style of the designer chosen, or you may wish to use your own approach. **All** sources should be properly referenced; one of our former IMD students [David Turner](https://davidturner.name/) created this very useful tool [ReferenceIt](https://referenceit.org) to help make the job easier. 
<!--
Before taking your essay to the web you should submit it to Turnitin for a quick review of originality. I will run through this process in Week 08.
<!--<!--
This project equates to 50% of your final mark for this module. 10% of this will cover use of proper grammar and spelling and another 10% will be given over to the final design.
<!--
You should write your essay with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) in the first instance. This will allow you to concentrate on the content at the beginning. Once completed you can convert it to [HTML5](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus) and add some CSS3 magic.
<!--
