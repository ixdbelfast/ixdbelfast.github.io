IXD102 - Introduction to Communication Design
====================

---

In this module we introduce students to the history of communication design. Starting with imagined communication devices of the future (Minority Report, Prometheus…) we rewind, in a single lecture, to the era of cave painting (Lascaux, Chauvet…), demonstrating the connections that bind human communication together.

For a more in-depth explanation of the module’s intent, including recommended reading, read the [abbreviated module descriptor](http://ixdbelfast.org/curriculum/0001/01/02/introduction-to-communication-design.html). (This module is run concurrently for students on both the BDes (Hons) Interaction Design and BSc (Hons) Interactive Multimedia Design courses.)

Week 01 - Introduction and Reverse History
------------------------------------------

Introduction to the module and a reverse view of what will be covered over the next eleven weeks.

### Friday Lecture

Today’s lecture covered a broad look at the module and what we are looking from you. 

The value of a solid knowledge and understanding of the history of design cannot be understated. As Confucius wisely said **“Study the past if you would define the future.”** Otherwise if you know what came before you will be equipped to design for whatever is to come. No one can work effectively in a creative vacuum.

If [Dieter Rams](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/dieter-rams) hadn’t come across the [Ulm School of Design](http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english) he may never have developed his iconic design for the [Braun Radio](http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/designing-for-dieter-rams) and if [Jonathan Ive](https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html) wasn’t aware of Rams he wouldn’t have designed the first iMac, iPod and the current range of Apple products we all know and love (or hate).


We looked at [Guillermo del Toro](http://www.fastcocreate.com/3020262/master-class/guillermo-del-toro-shares-14-horror-insights-from-his-spectacular-sketch-book) and saw how a knowledge and appreciation of past artists has helped him develop the fascinating creatures in the movies such as [Pan’s Labrynth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430) and [Pacific Rim](http://www.pacificrimmovie.com).

*IxD should also keep a weekly journal of their thoughts and progress on this and the other modules. It will help you rationalise what is covered and will provide a vehicle in which you can refer back to when you need to research material for future projects.


### Friday IxD Seminar

To kick things off we introduced two essential tools any self respecting interaction designer should be familiar with. 

This week we need you to download yourself a copy of [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) or [Atom](https://atom.io). Equally iyou can stick to your own preferred text editor.  Using the text in the attachment below, render what you see in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics). You should mark the headings, paragraphs, lists, etc as you see fit. 

Download the attached [Markdown zip file](resources/week01_markdown.zip) and, using the PDF as a guide, set the girona.txt file in Markdown. You won’t be able to match the PDF exactly (this will come later with the aid of the magic of CSS) but set it as you see fit using Markdown in your text editor.

#### Research Extras…

This weeks must watch movie is [2001 A Space Odyssey](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180404-why-2001-a-space-odyssey-remains-a-mystery). Yes, watching a movie can be research.

---

Week 02 – Cave Paintings to Illuminated Manuscripts
---------------------------------------------------

Starting with cave paintings we move forward to the first written language and end with illuminated manuscripts.

We covered a lot today with any one aspect worthy of a lecture in itself. But we have a lot more to cover in the coming weeks and rather than go into too much detail on the early history, today provided a taste for a number of different areas.

From man’s earliest markings at [Cantabria](http://cuevas.culturadecantabria.com/english/default.htm) the human race has been leaving its mark on the world in many different visual forms. They have been the source of inspiration for designers and artists such as [Picasso](http://www.picasso.fr/us/picasso_page_index.php), writers and movie directors such as [Ridley Scott](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000631/).

[Early writing](http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/themes/writing/historic_writing.aspx) forms cover millennia of mans history, with many different forms developing throughout the world. Thankfully, as designers, we usually only need to work with one language in our day-to-day routine, but on occasions we will need our work translated onto others. 

The [Golden Ratio](http://www.goldennumber.net) is abundant in nature and has been used by architects, artists and designers in the creation of their work for centuries. While not the only way to approach the design of your own work it is certainly a solid, tried-and-tested place to start.

[Tim Brown](https://dribbble.com/timbrown) has created a very useful online [Modular Scale](http://www.modularscale.com) which will help you – once you get to grips with CSS – to develop a well controlled balance to the typography on your Design Journal. Jeremy Church’s [Type Scale](http://type-scale.com) adds a very easy visual dimension to it. What’s more you can grab the CSS from here and add it to your own site.

Make sure to read Christopher Murphy’s [Contrast Through Scale](http://typecast.com/blog/contrast-through-scale) on Typecast's blog and add your thoughts in your Design Journal. 

Handwritten books, for many, many years, were the only way society could share and gather knowledge. The privilege of the powerful, religious bodies and the very rich, books were extremely expensive to reproduce restricting the spread of knowledge to those who could afford it.

Books were painstakingly created by [scribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribe), taking many months to complete one book, you can appreciate they were not cheap!

But by the mid 15th Century that was about to dramatically change and the days of the [Illuminated Scripts](https://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/TourIntroGen.asp) were numbered.

Week 03 – Guttenberg and Moveable Type
--------------------------------------

**The invention of the printing press revolutionises the dissemination of information and starts a typographic revolution in the process.**

This weeks lecture looked at the impact of the printing press and its influence on the spread of knowledge in the western world. We also picked out some of the pioneers of type design, looking at how improvements in the printing process helped shape the design of type. 

### Typography Today

A solid understanding of and appreciation for type is essential to your development as designers or developers. We will touch on typography frequently this semester and through all of the design modules so learn as much as you can about type. It will make you a stronger, better designer.

The following links to online resources and books will get you kicked off.

#### Web Typography

Check out Tim Brown’s [Nice Web Type](http://nicewebtype.com)

[Typekit][2] is a great way to get started with proper web fonts with lots of choices of good quality type. Unless you are familiar with CSS at this moment wait until that has been covered in your other module. You will be able to use two fonts free of charge on the trial account.

A showcase for Google fonts can be found on [hellohappy.org][4]

The home grown [Typecast](https://typecast.com) is well worth taking a look at and starting to use. 

A List Apart’s piece on [Typography & Web Fonts](http://alistapart.com/topic/typography-web-fonts) is worth reading. In fact you should keep a regular eye on [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com) for articles on all things web related.

[The League of Moveable Type’s blog](http://blog.theleagueofmoveabletype.com) is worth checking out

Week 04 – A Century of Change
----------------------------- 

As we saw the Industrial Revolution was a period of massive change, particularly the second revolution around 1840–1870. 

Society moved from an rural base to an urban one with a focus on mass production. People looking for work moved from the country into towns and cities where they found themselves involved in textile manufacturing, metal production, machine tool production. 

The period around 1900 was a massive time for change, with the introduction of numerous new technologies from the electric light bulb, radio transmissions, the motor vehicle, flight, photography, moving pictures… 

The growing demand for more materials, more steel for manufacturing, more machinery, more roads, more canals, more of railways, left little room for craft and quality. Soon artists and designers reacted against this industrialisation.

### Japonism

The opening of trading routes with Japan around the 1850s saw an influx of Japanese art and craft into Europe, particularly Paris, the epicentre for the arts at this time. This Japanese influence of Europe art became known as [Japonisme](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jpon/hd_jpon.htm).

The bold colours, flattened perspectives and graphic quality of Japanese woodblock [Ukiyo-e prints](http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/u/ukiyo-e-pictures-of-the-floating-world/) had a particularly profound effect on many artists towards the end of the 1800s. 

Artists such as Edouard Manet, [Claude Monet](https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/claude-monet), Edgar Degas, [Vincent Van Gogh](https://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/en/vincent-van-gogh-life-and-work), Paul Cezanne and [Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec](https://www.theartstory.org/artist-toulouse-lautrec-henri.htm) revolutionised the art world. They cast aside the traditions of Realism to portray the world as they saw it through Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. 

Artists crossed many disciplines from painting to sculpture, architecture and design. [Toulouse-Lautrec](http://www.toulouse-lautrec-foundation.org/) was a painter, illustrator and printmaker but is probably better know for his striking posters of Parisian life particularly the Moulin Rouge.

### Arts & Crafts Movement

The [Arts & Crafts](http://www.artsandcraftsmuseum.org.uk/Arts_and_Crafts_Movement/The_Arts_and_Crafts_Movement.aspx) Movement was essentially an anti Industrial Revolution movement. The Arts & Crafts aesthetic started as a reaction against the staid, production-line style developed by machine production. It drew its inspiration from nature keeping things simple without superfluous decoration.

[William Morris](http://www.vam.ac.uk/page/w/william-morris) was undoubtedly the leading figure of the Arts & Crafts. Best known for his distinctive textile designs Morris was also an artist, illustrator, author, typographer, printer, bookbinder and medievalist. He helped establish the modern fantasy genre influencing authors such as JRR Tolkien.

He also founded the Kelmscott Press publishing high quality books and influencing the revival of the private press, bringing the quality back to printing that the industrial age was losing.

### Art Nouveau

Taking its inspiration from natural forms and nature and imported Japanese arts and crafts the [Art Nouveau](https://www.theartstory.org/movement-art-nouveau.htm) style could be seen in architecture, ceramics, jewellery design, paintings and the newly emerging graphic design.

Artists associated with the movement included, amongst others, [Aubrey Beardsley](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/aubrey-beardsley-716) and [Alphonse Mucha](http://www.muchafoundation.org).

### The Glasgow School

[The Glasgow School](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/g/glasgow-school) grew from a group of influential artists and designers who began to gather in Glasgow. The most prominent members of the Glasgow School were known as [The Four](https://www.crmsociety.com/about-mackintosh/the-four/):

[Margaret MacDonald](https://www.crmsociety.com/about-mackintosh/the-four/margaret-macdonald/) – Painter and glass artist

[Charles Rennie Mackintosh](https://www.crmsociety.com/about-mackintosh/charles-rennie-mackintosh/) – Architect, designer, water colourist and artist and by far the most successful of The Four. He married Margaret MacDonald

[Frances MacDonald](https://www.crmsociety.com/about-mackintosh/the-four/frances-macdonald/) – Artist, designer, illustrator

[Herbert MacNair](https://www.crmsociety.com/about-mackintosh/the-four/james-herbert-macnair/) – Artist, designer and teacher. He married Frances MacDonald

### Vienna Secession

Also known as the Union of Austrian Artists, the [Vienna Secession](https://www.theviennasecession.com/vienna-secession/) formed in 1897 by a group of Austrian painters, sculptors and architects. One of the most prominent members of the group was [Gustav Klimt](https://www.theartstory.org/artist-klimt-gustav.htm) who is best known for his richly decorated paintings and murals.

[Peter Behrens](http://designhistoryresearch.wordpress.com/category/peter-behrens) is widely seen as the first true graphic designer.

Week 05 – The Influence of Modern Art
-------------------------------------

After the introduction of Japanese art and craft to Europe we witnessed a revolution in art and design in Europe and beyond. From Impressionism to Art Nouveau the speed of change accelerated and there was no turning back.

Where the Arts & Crafts movement fought the industrialisation of the world other movements embraced it…

### Plakatstil

In 1906, when the Priester Match Company held a competition to design a promotional poster they had to have been expecting a range of submissions in the richly decorative Art Nouveau style of the time. 

No one could have expected one strikingly simple entry which showed nothing but two matchsticks lying below the bold Priester namestyle. Designed by 23 year old designer [Lucian Bernhard](http://www.aiga.org/medalist-lucianbernhard) this minimalist approach to design became known as Plakatstil or Poster Style and Sachplakat (Object Poster).

Bernhard's simplified approach would influence design for years to follow and would be seen in everything from corporate identity to icon design.

The climate of antisemitism in Germany prompted Bernhard to emigrate to New York in 1923 where he opened a studio and worked as a graphic artist and interior designer . Bernhard also designed a large range of fonts during his career which included the still very popular [Bernhard Modern][2].

[2]:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Modern

### Propaganda and WWI

In Britain, the outbreak of World War One prompted the development of the Ministry of Information whose task was to mobilise public opinion against Germany and help with the war effort.

Recruitment posters were central to the war effort with the most common theme that of appeals for everyone to do their fair share. One of the most famous from this time has to have been the Lord Kitchener, 'Your Country Needs You' poster.

German military officials suggested that British propaganda was key to their defeat with Adolf Hitler later employing British propaganda techniques in his WWII campaign.

### Futurism

One of the most dynamic movements of this period Futurism, unlike Arts & Crafts, embraced the future celebrating the industrial age, speed, machinery and violence.

Established by writer and theorist [Filippo Marinetti](http://www.moma.org/collection/artists/3771) the movement grew to embrace painting, sculpture, architecture, poetry and photography. Futurist pieces reflected the energy of the industrial age and the horrors of war, paintings such as Umberto Boccioni's '[The City Rises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_Rises_(Boccioni))' show man's struggle with his surroundings while poems such as those in Marinetti's '[Words in Freedom](http://cdm.reed.edu/cdm4/artbooks/marinetti.php) reflect the same energies through groundbreaking use of typography.


### Dada

The Dadaist movement grew from a reaction against the horrors of World War I. Dada began in Zurich by artists and poets associated with the [Cabaret Voltaire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabaret_Voltaire_(Zurich)), the movement rejected logic and reason, in many way it was an anti-art movement questioning everything that came before it. [Marcel Duchamp's](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/marcel-duchamp-1036) [readymades](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readymades_of_Marcel_Duchamp) were the epitome of the movement. 

Other key members of the movement included, [Hannah Hoch](http://artsy.net/artist/hannah-hoch), [Raoul Hausmann](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/raoul-hausmann-1254) and [Kurt Schwitters](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/kurt-schwitters-1912).


### Art Deco

A heavily influential style, [Art Deco](http://www.vam.ac.uk/page/a/art-deco) originated in France after World War I and spread internationally on the 1930s and 40s. Art Deco combined traditional craft themes with industrial age imagery and materials. The style was characterised by bold colours, strong geometric shapes and rich ornamentation.

Where Art Nouveau, rejected technology, Art Deco embraced and celebrated industrialisation and the changes it brought. The movement could be seen in the visual arts, graphic design, ceramics, jewellery, architecture, furniture and product design.  

In graphic design, one of the best know figures was the Ukrainian-French painter, poster artist, typeface designer [A.M. Cassandre](http://www.cassandre-france.com).

His work for the Dubonnet wine company were among the first designed to be viewed from a moving vehicle where the message has to be big, bold and instantly recognisable.

This weeks **must watch** movies are…
- [Vertigo](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052357/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)
- [Un Chien Andalou](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020530/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_3)

---

Week 06 – Revolution and the Bauhaus
------------------------------------

The Russian Revolution and The Bauhaus generate visual vocabularies which still influence design today.

### De Stijl

As we saw De Stijl (The Style) was developed as a reaction to the First World War. Founders [Theo van Doesburg](http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=6076) and [Piet Mondrian](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/piet-mondrian-1651) were looking for a cure to the individualism and nationalist egotism they saw as the cause of the war. 

Their minimal, geometric abstract style could not be identified by any single country or individual and as such they saw this as the most suitable style for the post-war era.

#### Piet Mondrian

Prior to founding De Stijl, Dutch painter, Mondrian was heavily influenced by the Cubist work of Pablo Picasso and George Braque. The outbreak of WWI saw Mondrian remain in his home country of the Netherlands. When war ended in 1918 he returned to France where he began to produce the grid-based paintings he became famous for.

#### Theo van Doesburg

Artist, author, poet and architect Van Doesburg was influenced by the early works of Vincent van Gogh but this suddenly changed when he read [Wassily Kandinsky's](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/wassily-kandinsky-1382) biography. In Composition (The Cow) van Doesburg explored his reductive technique by distilling his studies of the cow down to simple geometric forms. The process acted as a means to educate his audience on his new approach to art and design.

Van Doesburg extended this process to type design with his geometric san-serif typeface. Designed in 1919, this incredibly modern typeface was based on a 25 square grid and almost 100 years later, on the right project, still wouldn't look out of place. The Foundry's [Architype Van Doesburg](http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/the-foundry-typefaces/architype-collections/params/architype-konstrukt/opentype/level-1/van-doesburg) revived the typeface for the digital age.

Van Doesburg travelled across Europe promoting the De Stijl movement and in 1922 became briefly involved with Dadaism working with Kurt Schwitters on the [Dada Campaign](http://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/2562-2) During this time he also worked with the Constructivists and became interested in the Bauhaus.

---

### Constructivism

Originating in Russia in 1919, the Constructivist movement placed art as a practice for social good. The movement had a far-reaching influence on 20th century modern art and design movements.

#### El Lissitzky

The Russian painter, typographer, architect and designer El Lissitzky illustrated Jewish books for children before developing his abstract images called [Prouns](http://azurebumble.wordpress.com/2012/04/16/el-lissitzky-prouns-series) which were ‘the interchange station between painting and architecture.’

He experimented widely with photomontage, printmaking, graphic design and print making becoming one of the central figures of the Constructivist movement.

#### Alexander Rodchenko

Artist, sculptor, photographer and graphic designer, [Alexander Rodchenko](http://aleksandrodchenko.wordpress.com), along with Lissitzky was one of the most prolific post-revolution Constructivist artists of this period. His striking designs for book covers, movie posters and advertisements combined strong geometric layouts, bold san-serif typography and photomontage to great effect. 

The Constructivist movement has been copied by many designers since its rise with designers today still influenced heavily by this very distinctive style. 

Patrick Burgoyne’s 2008 [Creative Review](http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2008/august/constructivism-the-ism-that-just-keeps-givin) piece looks at its impact.

### The Bauhaus

Having suffered the catastrophic defeat of WWI Germany was in a state of economic, political and cultural ruin. The need to rebuild all aspects of live was never more important. With new new director [Walter Gropius](http://www.bauhaus-dessau.de/bauhaus-1919-19333.html) at the helm, the Bauhaus school opened its doors in Germany in 1919 publishing its manifesto in local newspapers:

#### Bauhaus Manifesto
>“The ultimate goal of all art is the building! The ornamentation of the building was once the main purpose of the visual arts, and they were considered indispensable parts of the great building. Today, they exist in complacent isolation, from which they can only be salvaged by the purposeful and cooperative endeavours of all artisans. Architects, painters and sculptors must learn a new way of seeing and understanding the composite character of the building, both as a totality and in terms of its parts. Their work will then re-imbue itself with the spirit of architecture, which it lost in salon art.

>The art schools of old were incapable of producing this unity – and how could they, for art may not be taught. They must return to the workshop. This world of mere drawing and painting of draughtsmen and applied artists must at long last become a world that builds. When a young person who senses within himself a love for creative endeavour begins his career, as in the past, by learning a trade, the unproductive “artist” will no longer be condemned to the imperfect practice of art because his skill is now preserved in craftsmanship, where he may achieve excellence.

>Architects, sculptors, painters – we all must return to craftsmanship! For there is no such thing as “art by profession”. There is no essential difference between the artist and the artisan. The artist is an exalted artisan. Merciful heaven, in rare moments of illumination beyond man’s will, may allow art to blossom from the work of his hand, but the foundations of proficiency are indispensable to every artist. This is the original source of creative design.

>So let us therefore create a new guild of craftsmen, free of the divisive class pretensions that endeavoured to raise a prideful barrier between craftsmen and artists! Let us strive for, conceive and create the new building of the future that will unite every discipline, architecture and sculpture and painting, and which will one day rise heavenwards from the million hands of craftsmen as a clear symbol of a new belief to come."

#### The way forward

The Bauhaus years in Weimar (1919-1924) sought to unify art and craftsmanship in order to build a new future. Stained glass, wood and metal workshops were taught by craftsmen. 

Colour theory was covered by leading artists of the time – [Paul Klee](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/paul-klee-1417), [Wassily Kandinsky](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/wassily-kandinsky-1382) and later [Josef Albers](http://www.albersfoundation.org/Albers.php?inc=Introduction). While [Johannes Itten’s](http://bauhaus-online.de/en/atlas/personen/johannes-itten) preliminary course taught the fundamental principles of design and developed their understanding of the nature of materials. 

German painter, sculptor, designer and choreographer [Oskar Schlemmer](http://www.articons.co.uk/schlemmer.htm) ran the theatre workshop. Schlemmer’s work would inspire numerous theatre and dance groups such as Philippe Decouflé’s video for New Order’s [True Faith](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_rhnHpRSXQersfoundation.org/Albers.php?inc=Introduction). 

The schools exhibition of 1923 was attended by over 15,000 people and was internationally acclaimed. Itten was replaced the same year by [Laszlo Moholy-Nagy](http://www.moholy-nagy.com/index.html) as head of the preliminary course.

#### Laszlo Moholy-Nagy

As new head of the preliminary school Moholy-Nagy explored painting, photography, film, sculpture and graphic design. His love for photography and  typography developed an interest in the Bauhaus for visual communications. 

His photographic experiments replaced normal viewpoints with extreme close-ups, bird’s eye and worm’s eye views and angled viewpoints. He antagonised the Bauhaus artists claiming photography would eventually replace painting.

Tensions between the government and the Bauhaus eventually saw the school close in 1933 after the Gestapo demanded the removal of “cultural Bolsheviks” replacing staff with Nazi sympathisers.

Week 07 – WWII, HfG Ulm and Modernism in the US
-----------------------------------------------

World War II forces many of Europes most influential designers to flee to the safety of the US while the Ulm School of Design picks up the pieces in Germany.

This week took a look at Modernism in design and started with a few points looking at how the Modernist movement was defined.

- Reject traditional forms and decorative elements
- Seek a solution that is simple and direct
- Use systematic methods rather than intuitive ones
- Think about relationships in form and content
- Use geometric shapes: circle, triangle, square
- Use primary colours
- Use sans-serif typefaces
- Show contrast in typographical material
- Use photographs and photomontage rather than drawings or illustrations
- Use silhouetted photographs with white backgrounds
- Use maps and diagrams
- Use graphic symbols and icons
- Use of asymmetric page layout

A brief look at [degenerate art](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24819441) showed how Adolf Hitler persecuted modern artists, designers, musicians, basically anyone who didn't conform to his ideals.

Nazi persecution forced numerous artists, architects and designers to flee Europe for the safety of distant shores. Many mover to the US where the creative community welcomed them with open arms. The move saw a cultural shift of creativity and intellect from Europe to the States. However, all was not lost at home.

The [Ulm School of Design](http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english/) sought to redress the balance in Europe. The origins of Ulm School of Design goes back to the Scholl Foundation. The Scholl Foundation was created in 1950 by [Inge Scholl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inge_Scholl) in memory of their siblings Sophie and Hans Scholl, members of the resistance group "White Rose" who were executed by the Nazis in 1943.

Inge, along with [Otl Aicher](http://www.1972municholympics.co.uk/otl_aicher.php) and [Max Bill](http://www.max-bill.com) founded the Ulm School of Design in 1953 where it quickly gained a reputation ans one of the finest design schools in the world, second only to the Bauhaus.

The shift of creative talent to the US had a profound effect on the resident design community. Previously, Modernism had been rejected when the 1913 Armoury Show introduced the movement to America. Designers eager to learn from Modernism had to satisfy their thirst through exhibition catalogues and brochures from their European counterparts.

The movement didn’t making a lasting impact until the 1930s when artists, architects and designers started to flee Europe for the safety of the US.

Key designers of the American Modernist movement included Alexey Brodovitch, Herbert Bayer, Herbert Matter, Paul Rand, Saul Bass and Milton Glaser to name a handful.

Week 08 – The International Typographic Style
---------------------------------------------

Often referred to as the International Style or the The Swiss Style, the [International Typographic Style](http://vanseodesign.com/web-design/swiss-design) originated in Switzerland in the 1950s and remained a major movement in design for over 20 years. 

Still influencing designers today the movement was refined at two design schools design. In Basel it was led by [Armin Hofmann](http://www.aiga.org/medalist-arminhofmann) and [Emil Ruder](http://www.designishistory.com/1940/emil-ruder/) while [Josef Müller-Brockman](http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature/article/reputations-josef-muller-brockmann) headed the movement in Zurich. 

The movement still plays a major role in influencing contemporary design with many of the principles found in the current trend for [flat design](http://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/what-flat-design-3132112) bound in the Swiss Style. Designers such as [Olly Moss](http://ollymoss.com/) have found inspiration in the works of Josef Müller-Brockmann and others.
