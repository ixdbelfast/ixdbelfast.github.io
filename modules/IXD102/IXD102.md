IXD102 - Introduction to Communication Design
====================


----

In this module we introduce students to the history of communication design. Starting with imagined communication devices of the future (Minority Report, Prometheus…) we rewind, in a single lecture, to the era of cave painting (Lascaux, Chauvet…), demonstrating the connections that bind human communication together.

For a more in-depth explanation of the module’s intent, including recommended reading, read the [abbreviated module descriptor](http://ixdbelfast.org/curriculum/0001/01/02/introduction-to-communication-design.html). (This module is run concurrently for students on both the BDes (Hons) Interaction Design and BSc (Hons) Interactive Multimedia Design courses.)

###Week 01 - Introduction and Reverse History

**Friday 25th September 2015**


The value of a solid knowledge and understanding of the history of design cannot be understated. As Confucius wisely said 

>“Study the past if you would define the future.”

Otherwise, if you know what came before you will be better equipped to design for whatever is to come. No one can work effectively in a creative vacuum. Fact.

If [Dieter Rams](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/dieter-rams) hadn’t come across the [Ulm School of Design](http://www.hfg-archiv.ulm.de/english) he may never have developed his iconic design for the [Braun Radio](http://www.eyemagazine.com/blog/post/designing-for-dieter-rams) and if [Jonathan Ive](https://www.apple.com/uk/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html) wasn’t aware of Rams he wouldn’t have designed the first iMac, iPod and the current range of Apple products we all know and love (or hate).

We looked at [Guillermo del Toro](http://www.fastcocreate.com/3020262/master-class/guillermo-del-toro-shares-14-horror-insights-from-his-spectacular-sketch-book) and saw how a knowledge and appreciation of past artists has helped him develop the fascinating creatures in the movies such as [Pan’s Labrynth](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430) and [Pacific Rim](http://www.pacificrimmovie.com).

While not an accessible aspect of the course you should try to keep a weekly journal of your thoughts and progress on this and the other modules. It will help you rationalise what is covered and will provide a vehicle in which you can refer back to when you need to research material for future projects. It will also show us and potential employers that you are interested and engaged.

###Project 01
Your first project for this module is to create a [Type Specimen Poster](https://uk.pinterest.com/jsgore/typography-type-specimen-posters/) based on **one** of the fonts.

- Jenson
- Bembo
- Garamond
- Caslon
- Baskerville
- Bodoni
- Akzindenz-Grotesk

You poster should be A3 (420mm x 297mm) and ideally created in Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop, alternatively you may use [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) (students can avail of a 50% discount for this excellent product). If you are not familiar with any of these yet don't panic. You could use (and it pains me to say this) Microsoft Word until you get to grips with the former. 

The poster should be posted to your webspace (IMD) or your GitHub site (IxD) **there is no need to print anything**. Don't worry if you don't have either up and running yet just save what you have until you're ready to upload it.

Research the subject to get a handle on what a type specimen poster should look like (you could even write a little blog post on the subject) before putting **pencil to paper**. Don't just rely on the links we provide, find your own material. As with any creative project **always, always, always** start on paper **never** jump straight onto a computer, you will never create anything meaningful this way.

You poster should obviously feature your chosen font but you should also include a couple of paragraphs on the designer who created the font, give us a little background to who they are and what else they may have created. Don't worry if you don't have access to the fonts, use one that looks closest to it.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to get in touch.

**Completion Date: Friday 9th October 2015** Rather than take a look through these in Week 04 I will leave the first feedback session until Week 07 when we can look at the first two projects (two posters for IMD and one for IxD (IxD have a group project instead of the second poster)) this will give everyone time to reflect on the first project and improve on things if necessary.

###Friday IxD Seminar

To kick things off we introduced two essential tools any self respecting interaction designer should be familiar with. 

This week, if you don't have a preferred text editor, you should download yourself a copy of [Brackets](http://brackets.io) and, using the text in the attachment below, set what you see into [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics). You should mark the headings, paragraphs, lists, etc as you see fit. Keep a copy of what you have created and once we get you up and running on GitHub you can upload it there.

Download the attached [Markdown Exercise](resources/markdown_exercise.zip) (right-click and save the zip file to your computer) and, using the PDF as a guide set the markdown_raw.rtf file into Markdown. You won’t be able to match the PDF exactly (this will come later with the aid of the magic of CSS) but set it as you see fit using Markdown in Brackets (or your own preferred text editor).

###Week 02 – Cave Paintings to Illuminated Manuscripts 


Starting with cave paintings we move forward to the first written language and end with illuminated manuscripts.

We covered a lot today with any one aspect worthy of a lecture in itself. But we have a lot more to cover in the coming weeks and rather than go into too much detail on the early history, today provided a taste for a number of different areas.


From man’s earliest markings at [Cantabria](http://cuevas.culturadecantabria.com/english/default.htm) the human race has been leaving its mark on the world in many different visual forms. They have been the source of inspiration for designers and artists such as [Picasso][2], writers and movie directors such as [Ridley Scott][3].

[Early writing][4] forms cover millennia of mans history, with many different forms developing throughout the world. Thankfully, as designers, we usually only need to work with one language in our day-to-day routine, but on occasions we will need our work translated onto others. 

The [Golden Ratio][6] is abundant in nature and has been used by architects, artists and designers in the creation of their work for centuries. While not the only way to approach the design of your own work it is certainly a solid, tried-and-tested place to start.

[Tim Brown][7] has created a very useful online [Modular Scale][8] which will help you – once you get to grips with CSS – to develop a well controlled balance to the typography on your Design Journal. Jeremy Church’s [Type Scale](http://type-scale.com) adds a very easy visual dimension to it. What’s more you can grab the CSS from here and add it to your own site.

Make sure to read Christopher Murphy's [Contrast Through Scale][1] on Typecast's blog and add your thoughts in your Design Journal. 

Handwritten books, for many, many years, were the only way society could share and gather knowledge. The privilege of the powerful, religious bodies and the very rich, books were extremely expensive to reproduce restricting the spread of knowledge to those who could afford it.

Books were painstakingly created by [scribes][9], taking many months to complete one book, you can appreciate they were not cheap!

But by the mid 15th Century that was about to dramatically change and the days of the [Illuminated Scripts][10] were numbered…

###IMD Group Logo Design

Week 03 – Guttenberg and Moveable Type
--------------------------------------

**The invention of the printing press revolutionises the dissemination of information and starts a typographic revolution in the process.**

This weeks lecture looked at the impact of the printing press and its influence on the spread of knowledge in the western world. We also picked out some of the pioneers of type design, looking at how improvements in the printing process helped shape the design of type. 

###Typography Today

A solid understanding of and appreciation for type is essential to your development as designers or developers. We will touch on typography frequently this semester and through all of the design modules so learn as much as you can about type. It will make you a stronger, better designer.

The following links to online resources and books will get you kicked off.

####Web Typography

Check out Tim Brown's [Nice Web Type][1]

[Typekit][2] is a great way to get started with proper web fonts with lots of choices of good quality type. Unless you are familiar with CSS at this moment wait until that has been covered in your other module. You will be able to use two fonts free of charge on the trial account.

A showcase for Google fonts can be found on [hellohappy.org][4]

The home grown [Typecast][5] is worth taking a look at. 

A List Apart's piece on [Typography & Web Fonts][6] is worth reading. In fact you should keep a regular eye on [A List Apart][7] for articles on all things web related.

[The League of Moveable Type's blog][3] is worth checking out

Week 04 – A Century of Change
----------------------------- 

As we saw the Industrial Revolution was a period of massive change, particularly the second revolution around 1840–1870. 

Society moved from an rural base to an urban one with a focus on mass production. People looking for work moved from the country into towns and cities where they found themselves involved in textile manufacturing, metal production, machine tool production. 

The time around 1900 was a massive period for change, with the introduction of numerous new technologies from the electric light bulb, radio transmissions, the motor vehicle, flight, photography, moving pictures… 

The growing demand for more materials, more steel for manufacturing, more machinery, more roads, more canals, more of railways, left little room for craft and quality. Soon artists and designers reacted against this industrialisation.

####Japonism

The opening of trading routes with Japan around the 1850s saw an influx of Japanese art and craft into Europe, particularly Paris, the epicentre for the arts at this time. This Japanese influence of Europe art became known as [Japonisme][1].

The bold colours, flattened perspectives and graphic quality of Japanese woodblock prints had a particularly profound effect on many artists towards the end of the 1800s. 

Artists such as Edouard Manet, Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, Vincent Van Gogh, Paul Cezanne and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec revolutionised the art world. They cast aside the traditions of Realism to portray the world as they saw it through Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. 

Artists crossed many disciplines from painting to sculpture, architecture and design. [Toulouse-Lautrec][2] was a painter, illustrator and printmaker but is probably better know for his striking posters of Paris life particularly the Moulin Rouge.

###Arts & Crafts Movement

The Arts & Crafts Movement was essentially an anti Industrial Revolution movement. The Arts & Crafts aesthetic started as a reaction against the staid, production-line style developed by machine production. It drew its inspiration from nature keeping things simple without superfluous decoration.

**[William Morris][3]** was undoubtedly the leading figure of the Arts & Crafts. Best known for his distinctive textile designs Morris was also an artist, illustrator, author, typographer, printer, bookbinder and medievalist. He helped establish the modern fantasy genre influencing authors such as JRR Tolkien.

He also founded the Kelmscott Press publishing high quality books and influencing the revival of the private press, bringing the quality back to printing that the industrial age was losing.

###Art Nouveau

Taking its inspiration from natural forms and nature and imported Japanese arts and crafts the [Art Nouveau][4]  style could be seen in architecture, ceramics, jewellery design, paintings and the newly emerging graphic design.

Artists associated with the movement included, amongst others, [Aubrey Beardsley][5] and [Alphonse Mucha][6]

###The Glasgow School

[The Glasgow School][7] grew from a group of influential artists and designers who began to gather in Glasgow. The most prominent members of the Glasgow School were known as The Four:

[Margaret MacDonald][8] – Painter and glass artist

[Charles Rennie Mackintosh][9] – Architect, designer, water colourist and artist and by far the most successful of The Four. He married Margaret MacDonald

[Frances MacDonald][10] – Artist, designer, illustrator

[Herbert MacNair][11] – Artist, designer and teacher. He married Frances MacDonald

###Vienna Secession

Also known as the Union of Austrian Artists, the Vienna Secession formed in 1897 by a group of Austrian painters, sculptors and architects. One of the most prominent members of the group was [Gustav Klimt][13] who is best known for his richly decorated paintings and murals.

[Peter Behrens](http://designhistoryresearch.wordpress.com/category/peter-behrens) is widely seen as the first true graphic designer.

Week 05 – The Influence of Modern Art
-------------------------------------

After the introduction of Japanese art and craft to Europe we witnessed a revolution in art and design in Europe and beyond. From Impressionism to Art Nouveau the speed of change accelerated and there was no turning back.

Where the Arts & Crafts movement fought the industrialisation of the world other movements embraced it…

####Plakatstil

In 1906, when the Priester Match Company held a competition to design a promotional poster they had to have been expecting a range of submissions in the richly decorative Art Nouveau style of the time. 

No one could have expected one strikingly simple entry which showed nothing but two matchsticks lying below the bold Priester namestyle. Designed by 23 year old designer [Lucian Bernhard](http://www.aiga.org/medalist-lucianbernhard) this minimalist approach to design became known as Plakatstil or Poster Style and Sachplakat (Object Poster).

Bernhard's simplified approach would influence design for years to follow and would be seen in everything from corporate identity to icon design.

The climate of antisemitism in Germany prompted Bernhard to emigrate to New York in 1923 where he opened a studio and worked as a graphic artist and interior designer . Bernhard also designed a large range of fonts during his career which included the still very popular [Bernhard Modern][2].

[2]:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Modern

####Propaganda and WWI

In Britain, the outbreak of World War One prompted the development of the Ministry of Information whose task was to mobilise public opinion against Germany and help with the war effort.

Recruitment posters were central to the war effort with the most common theme that of appeals for everyone to do their fair share. One of the most famous from this time has to have been the Lord Kitchener, 'Your Country Needs You' poster.

German military officials suggested that British propaganda was key to their defeat with Adolf Hitler later employing British propaganda techniques in his WWII campaign.

####Futurism

One of the most dynamic movements of this period Futurism, unlike Arts & Crafts, embraced the future celebrating the industrial age, speed, machinery and violence.

Established by writer and theorist [Filippo Marinetti][3] the movement grew to embrace painting, sculpture, architecture, poetry and photography. Futurist pieces reflected the energy of the industrial age and the horrors of war, paintings such as Umberto Boccioni's '[The City Rises][4]' show man's struggle with his surroundings while poems such as those in Marinetti's '[Words in Freedom][5] reflect the same energies through groundbreaking use of typography.

[5]:http://cdm.reed.edu/cdm4/artbooks/marinetti.php

####Dada

The Dadaist movement grew from a reaction against the horrors of World War I. Dada began in Zurich by artists and poets associated with the [Cabaret Voltaire][10], the movement rejected logic and reason, in many way it was an anti-art movement questioning everything that came before it. [Marcel Duchamp's][6] [readymades][11] were the epitome of the movement. 

Other key members of the movement included, [Hannah Hoch][7], [Raoul Hausmann][8] and [Kurt Schwitters][9]…

####Art Deco

A heavily influential style, [Art Deco][1] originated in France after World War I and spread internationally on the 1930s and 40s. Art Deco combined traditional craft themes with industrial age imagery and materials. The style was characterised by bold colours, strong geometric shapes and rich ornamentation.

Where Art Nouveau, rejected technology Art Deco embraced and celebrated industrialisation and the changes it brought. The movement could be sen in the visual arts, graphic design, ceramics, jewellery, architecture, furniture and product design.  

In graphic design, one of the best know figures was the Ukrainian-French painter, poster artist, typeface designer [A.M. Cassandre][2].

His work for the Dubonnet wine company were among the first designed to be viewed from a moving vehicle. The message has to be big, bold and instantly recognisable.
