I started teaching at The Belfast School of Art in 2004. From the moment I joined, I made the case for an Interaction Design course that placed design at its heart. It might have taken us ten years to get here (the pace of change in academia is glacial), but I'm delighted to announce that after a decade of lobbying we finally have a new course, which will start in September, 2014.

We've built a fantastic team all of whom, importantly, work in this industry. Together with [Paul McCormack][PM] and [Tim Potter][TP], we've built a curriculum that I believe is fit for purpose and, eqaully importantly, will grow and evolve as our industry changes.

In the spirit of openness that underpins the web, we've opened up our curriculum on GitHub. Everything we teach is out in the open, we're not hiding anything. Our curriculum will, of course, evolve as we begin delivering it. We'll learn from our mistakes and rectify them in a timely manner.

As a team we're excited to be working with a new group of students who will be joining us in September. We're developing the design course we would all have liked to study on. We're excited about the possibilities ahead and we're looking forward to sharing our progress with you.
