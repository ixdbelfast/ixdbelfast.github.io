<h1>Why Belfast?</h1>

<p>Belfast is a vibrant city rapidly establishing itself as a visitor destination on a world stage. Lonely Planet describe Belfast as, “A city on the rise,” and - when one visits the city - it’s easy to see why.</p>

<p>The city, in stark contrast to its past image, combines a rich industrial heritage with a thriving cafe culture. This energy and dynamism has seen the city play host to numerous international events, most recently hosting the <a href="http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/giro2014/view.aspx">Giro d’Italia’s Big Start</a>, which saw three days of world class cycling in the city.</p>

<p>As Northern Ireland’s capital city, Belfast has enjoyed over a decade of rapid economic growth. The city’s skyline has changed significantly over the last few years thanks to considerable investment, the result is a truly cosmopolitan city with a world-renowned welcoming culture.</p>

<p>Belfast has all the major facilities that one would expect from a city that has seen great change and investment in recent times and with its welcoming nature and vibrant creative community it continues to be a highly desirable destination for local, national and international students.</p>

<h2>The Belfast School of Art</h2>

<p>The Belfast School of Art is a world leading art school located in the heart of Belfast’s historic Cathedral Quarter. The School has an internationally recognised reputation as a leader in art and design education, with graduates including: celebrated children’s book illustrator <a href="http://www.oliverjeffers.com">Oliver Jeffers</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Philipsz">Susan Philipsz</a>, the 2010 Turner Prize Winner.</p>

<p>The School is located in a new state of the art building on the Ulster University’s Belfast campus. Located in the Cathedral Quarter, the University plays a leading role in the creative and cultural life of the city.</p>

<p>The School’s teaching staff are practicing artists and designers. All are involved in industry and use this real world knowledge to inform and shape their teaching, ensuring it is up to date and relevant.</p>

<p>The course team play a central role in organising numerous events to support Belfast’s thriving digital community. The team are actively involved in running many extra-curricular events, including: <a href="http://www.ulsterfestival.com">The Ulster Festival of Art and Design</a>, a week long festival that attracts leading designers from all over the world; <a href="http://refreshbelfast.com">Refresh Belfast</a>, a quarterly series of evening events aimed at the city’s web design community; and <a href="http://breakconf.org">Break</a>, a new design conference attracting an international audience.</p>

<h2>Belfast’s Digital Community</h2>

<p>Belfast is rapidly establishing itself as a key player on a world stage: Andy McMillan’s sterling work with <a href="http://buildconf.com">Build</a> needs no introduction; the team at <a href="http://typecast.com">Typecast</a> are taking the wonderful world of web typography to new heights; and Cargo’s recently unveiled <a href="http://www.brewbot.io">Brewbot</a> is rightly winning the praise it deserves.</p>

<p>Coupled with these industry successes, our graduates are increasingly making their mark on an international stage. Danny Turley’s <a href="http://performasports.com">Performa Sports</a>, an iOS app designed for analysts, coaches and players to analyse and improve their performances, is rapidly securing high profile clients worldwide.</p>

<p>Kyle Gawley and David Turner, just one year from graduation, are building a world class web-based ticketing solution, <a href="https://getinvited.to">Get Invited</a>. Get Invited has secured over a quarter of a million pounds of investment, enabling the team to grow the business and ticket events throughout the world.</p>

<p>Belfast is firmly on the map, right where it deserves to be. We think you’ll love the city, the people are warm and friendly and our digital community is tight knit and supportive. We’re looking for passionate individuals with a desire to learn. <a href="http://ixdbelfast.org/apply/">If that’s you, join us in Belfast for what we promise will be a thrilling adventure.</a></p>
