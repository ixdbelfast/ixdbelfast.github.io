	<h1>Applying to IxD</h1>

	<p>Students work both individually and collaboratively in a dynamic studio environment designed to provide them with the skills required to work within a rapidly growing global industry.</p>

	<p>The first year equips students with a solid understanding of communication design fundamentals, both on-screen and, importantly, off-screen. Projects include: paper-based interaction design exercises; an introduction to the fundamentals of HTML and CSS; an overview of imagery and its role in communication; and an exploration of identity and the psychology of branding, which enables students to develop their own, professional online presence.</p>

	<p>Year two focuses on narrative and how we tell stories. It introduces further technical skills required to build exciting applications, in particular JavaScript and the use of APIs. The second year also has a strong entrepreneurial focus, designed to introduce students to the realities of business and equip them with the skills and thinking needed to develop and sell their own digital products.</p>

	<p>In the final year of the course, the emphasis shifts towards self-directed study through the creation a substantial portfolio of work. This shift in focus towards self-direction is designed to ensure graduates are employable and able to work under their own direction. Opportunities also exist to develop new digital products with potential for commercialisation beyond the course.</p>

	<p>The course also engages students with a range of industry led projects and international competitions designed to showcase their abilities on a world stage amongst their peers.</p>

	<h2>Portfolio and Interview</h2>

	<p>Students are selected through portfolio and interview. The course team encourage potential applicants to show their creativity through their portfolio, which can be paper-based, screen-based or both. We want to see evidence of your thinking and we would encourage you to bring sketchbooks and working drawings that show us how your ideas were developed. We’ll work with you to improve your drawing and technical skills. You do not need to be a computer genius to join this course – at this stage we are more concerned with your creative potential.</p>

	<h2>Do I need to be a computer expert?</h2>

	<p>No. Throughout the course students will be introduced to the industry standard digital skills necessary to produce high quality, creative outcomes. Students develop the practical, creative and theoretical skills that will enable them to address both given projects and their own work through the use of various media.</p>

	<h2>What next?</h2>

	<p>The BDes (Hons) Interaction Design is taught at the Ulster University, Belfast campus which has been redeveloped and provides an excellent environment for study in the heart of the City’s historic Cathedral Quarter.
